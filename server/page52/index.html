	  <h2><a href="/2009/10/05/being-lost.html">being lost</a></h2>
	  Yesterday or the day before, sunday, anyway, I was driving down the highway and I had this sudden feeling of disconnectedness, of being lost. Like when in the night you wake up and don't know where you are. <br /><br />I was coming around a curve, and it was raining, cloudy, but I know that section of road, have driven it many times. There's the normal state of having been somewhere, and you remember, for example, that the bathroom is behind you and your car is out in the parking lot or driveway, and that the roads that led you there also lead to home. It's a grounded feeling, a feeling that lets you ignore parts of the landscape that aren't normal. <br /><br />For a brief second, coming around that curve, it was like all those connections, where I was going and where I was coming from, and everything that I knew the location of, all of that was cut off, and it was as if I was floating above it. It's so odd because I normally have a very good sense of the space I'm in and what is around me. <br /><br />Then, I looked around I saw every detail of everything, blades of grass and tree branches, and the cars a quarter mile back, and the shapes of the clouds, and then, gradually, over a period of ten seconds, the feeling faded, and while I didn't feel really normal for a couple minutes, the hyper-awareness was gone and the highway was just highway, and the sky was just sky, and the weirdness went away, just like it does when you turn on the light in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Anyway, now back to your regularly scheduled blog. There's some nice pics from plaza fest and outtakes from the naked sun shoot coming up, so stay tuned.

	  All of these need captions, but instead of me writing them, you should pull out a sharpie and write them in in the whitespace between the pictures. No, not really. Seriously though, the conference was really fun, I learned a lot about podcasting and a little about blogging. Breakfast from prairie thunder, coffee from cafe evoke and lunch from iguana, all wonderful. It was nice to meet everyone, and hopefully you all like the photos. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0005.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0006.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0007.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0008.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0009.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0010.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0011.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0012.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0013.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0014.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0015.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0016.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>

	  Friday was fun as shit. Definitely the best night out I've had in a while that didn't involve getting far too drunk. Actually, there was drinking, of course. But the funness was from the dancing and the company, Amber and Kat and some of their friends, oh yeah, and I saw Grizzly Bear's tour bus.  At least, that's what someone said it was. No idea who these bands were, forgot their names already, go to the opolis web site and look i9f you care, but they honestly weren't that great, or I would have written the names down or shot the poster or something. But the night as a whole was a blast. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Ghost Bike:</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This guy sucked.

	  I swear I'm not turning into <a href="http://jeremycharles.com">Jeremy Charles</a>, or worse, Annie Leibowitz, but I do seem to be shooting a lot of musicians lately. This band I didn't really like. The sound was super mellow, smooth jazz like, and it really did nothing for me. There were some good moments, when it seemed like a song would break out and do something interesting, but then it got drowned in the hopeless drone. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  Well, samples from the half hour that I was there. It seemed like a really fun time, and if I hadn't been sleep depping and working and whatnot this weekend, I probably would have really enjoyed doing some classes and just sitting around kibitzing with everyone. I could have gotten some of my bookbinding experiments done maybe.
