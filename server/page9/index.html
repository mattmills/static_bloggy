<p>the patio is still the best place in the city to get some air and a bite at the same time. it&#8217;s going to be a regular stop for me as soon as they get real beer.</p>

	  <p>Speaking of the city, I was riding around the other day, and had another one of those moments, where I saw something that caught me. I took this photo:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/january_10/0022.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /></p>
<p>Something about the combination of being in a big space (the structures always have that effect on me; I realize how much sky there is up there) and all the activity of construction made the growth the city is experiencing real to me. Like before, it was politicians talking about it, people bitching about it never going to happen, and here we are. It could be nice. Let&#8217;s make it nice.</p>

	  <p>well, not my neighborhodd, but the one I was staying in&#8230; I conceived a big typology type project while I was there. All the cemeteries of New Orleans. Of course, I&#8217;d have to live there&#8230; if the city doesn&#8217;t sink before I get the chance to move there, that is. It&#8217;d be a couple years. When I&#8217;m looking to semi-retire or something. or when I get a wild hair and have to light out. Although, as my local friends advised me, it&#8217;d be easier if I picked a subset to look at. I could spend a long time looking at these angels, for example.</p>

	  <p>So we drove down to Cocodrie, which is the middle of nowhere, reaching out towards the gulf of mexico. Even the middle of nowhere has trash pickup these days. That&#8217;s america for ya. The birds were nice, flying to roost somewhere at sunset, and the sunset was pretty awesome, too. Nice to get away from it all for a minute. Which was the point of the trip, come to think of it.</p>
