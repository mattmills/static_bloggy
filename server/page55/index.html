	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/03/sherree-chamberlain.html">Sherree Chamberlain</a></h2>
	  This is the band and the singer/songwriter that the crew that I was there to photograph was there to film. Wait, let me rephrase. I showed up and my friend Tomee was there with a film crew to record Sherree and her band, and Tomee asked me if I would shoot some production stills, so I did. And I got backstage access for the whole show, and some nice pictures; My friend and fellow photographer <a href="http://jeremycharles.com">Jeremy Charles</a> said something on twitter about the joy of the performer being why he does concert photography, and I saw what he meant shooting these pictures. I shouldn't be surprised that he also has a <a href="http://www.jeremycharles.com/blog/index.php/2009/05/27/sherree-chamberlain-photos/">gallery</a> of photos of Chamberlain too. Dude knows what's up. Girl can sing and entertain and has the look too. <br /> <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  Sunday was location scouting. And thrift stores. And a nondisclosure agreement, so I'm not sure what I can and can't say, but none of these are embargoed, formally or informally, so there you have it. We're working on cool shit, and when it comes out it's going to be really rad, but that's not for four months or so, so expect teasers and hints and nothing substantive until at least january.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Credit where credit is due: photo by Chelsea M'lynn.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  Monday rolls around and I'm looking for polaroid film when who should call me but <a href="http://www.furburger.org">Christa May</a>, wondering if I'm down for a little libation at Mcnellie's. Of course I am. I'm always down for Mcnellie's.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Logan and Matt, not me, but Christa's new dude.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/02/uglysuit.html">Uglysuit</a></h2>
	  So last saturday and sunday I was in stillwater for various reasons including location scouting and "for the hell of it." I rolled out of OKC at 9pm, right after work, and rolled into stillwater at around 10, rolling right up to a show and betting an assignment for production stills in the first five minutes of being there. <br /><br />Anyway, I'm getting out of the car and combobulating myself (grabbing my camera and checking the settings and making sure I have an extra battery and card) and I hear the band that's playing, don't know who it is, but they sound good. Then I walk in and recognize Uglysuit on stage. Fucking good show. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/02/random-friends.html">Random friends</a></h2>
	  Hopefully I can be forgiven for sandwiching these photos of some friends I ran into at the concert in between band posts... these are cool people, as far as I know. I mean, I'm not their mother, so I can't be a character witness, but at least they knew where the cool show was in stillwater that night and made it out, so that says something. And some of them, the ones I know better, are verified badass. So, guilt by association with me:<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/concertfriends/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/concertfriends/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/concertfriends/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/02/one-picture.html">One picture</a></h2>
	  There's a story in news-photographer apocrypha about an old school photographer who went out on assignment to someplace very remote; say, China. Mongolia. Now this guy was old school to our old school; learned to photograph with a 4x5 and knew a time when lens caps doubled as shutters. He went to China with a new nikon 35mm and when he got back, as he was deplaning, an assistant for whatever paper he was working for met him just off the plane to rush his film to the lab. He pulls out his camera, rewinds the roll that's inside, and hands it to the assistant, saying "Print 'em both, kid."<br /><br />Now, I'm not a fan of the slow, patient photography that this implies; neither am I a proponent of going out to an event and overheating a motor drive taking way too many pictures. I like to take a series of pictures that tells the story over time. But there is something to be said for being patient, and taking less pictures. The night I took this photo, I took two; this one and one of the inside of my bag as I was putting the camera away. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/onepic/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Now I have to go and edit the pictures from the next night, where I shot 500 pictures in a couple hours. There's a lot going on here at matt mills world HQ, so stay tuned.
