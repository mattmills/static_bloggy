  <h2>coffee and cigarettes</h2>
  ...are what the gods gave us to make up for all the shit they put on us. Sometimes, it's enough to make up for it. Sometimes, not so much.<br /><br />Women. What the hell? I thought I'd found someone, and now she's gone off with another guy. (I'm struck now by the recurring themes in my love life, but I digress). How often have I met a woman that I thought was really worthwhile? I'm not talking meet someone who just happens to be smart or sexy and I'm attracted to, but more like love at first sight. You catch a glimpse of her and it's a physical feeling, taking a blow to the head, to the chest, whatever, and you know already that she'll be amazing. <br /><br />It's happened to me three times. I don't know why three, not one or none, I don't know why I'm not still with any of these three wonderful gorgeous smart girls, I don't know a lot of things. My life has been, so far, very much a series of strange and wonderful events that I don't have any hope of understanding.<br /><br />I'll tell the first story, and because she's still around, in the OKC area somewhere, I've gotta come up with an alias. Call her Annie. So, I was in the sixth grade. Walking down a hall at an academic team tourney (jeopardy for schoolkids). we both looked up at the same time, right into each other's eyes, and said "I know you..." Which, of course, we didn't. <br /><br />We talked for a second, and then I didn't see her again until maybe 6 months later. Maybe it was less, maybe it was more.  And I was so inept then that she actually got my phone number first, on some lame excuse. OK, I lied when I used past tense just then. I still suck at details like getting names and numbers. Anyway, we went out for a little less than a year. By then, I was in the eighth grade, and I was talking with my dad, who always has good advice that I don't want to hear, and I could see my whole life stretching out before me. A nice, normal life, go to a state school for free, get a nice job somewhere safe, have my girl with me through the whole thing, yada yada. <br /><br />That's exactly what I thought. How boring. Lame. Go do something fun and exciting with your life. You've gotta burn it up, gotta be more than a cog in a hierarchy of other cogs. Get out of that now, while you can. So, to separate myself from all of that, to cut it off, I did the most destructive thing I could think of: I broke up with the girl I loved. I still don't sleep right.
