  <h2>weird search</h2>
  so people are still coming here searching for "Matt Mills porn". You kids are weird. First of all, I don't even have a girlfriend. Second of all, I don't do porn. Artful nudes, maybe, and a friend of mine once asked me to do suicide girl shoot for her, but that never went through and so I really have nothing remotely like porn for you people. <br /><br />Meanwhile, work work work. Went to see Adam yesterday, he seems all right. Broke up as all hell, but all things that'll heal eventually. I'm not a doctor, nor a psychologist,  but I have a feeling he's gonna make a good recovery. Tons of good people around him (I mean all the folks I've met over the last few weeks, the Hellcats and boneshakers and just the community around bikes, really lots of awesome people. <br /><br />I also discovered I don't know how to stick weld at all. I was over at KW's house, he has a workshop and a welding machine. So I decided to build a frankenbike, and then I couldn't put two pieces of metal together to save my life. Although I told my dad what was going on (he's a weldor) and he said it was a case of everything in the situation being wrong, not just that I didn't know any technique. Rod was oxidized and probably too large, so useless. I'll try again next week maybe. Dad said he'd show me some things too, so that'll be cool. <br /><br />And I gotta go sleep. Catch you later, internets.
