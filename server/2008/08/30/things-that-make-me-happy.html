  <h2>Things that make me happy...</h2>
  Yesterday I had the most exciting time mowing the grass. You know, normally I hate it, it's boring drudgery in the hot sun, but I got home about half an hour before storms were coming in. So I decided to race the storms to get the front yard mowed. there was distant lightening and darkening skies and me, running to try and get done. I made it, just as the first drops came down. <br /><br />I was all tired after that, and I wasn't going to go out, but then KW texted me (I have a feeling he bulk texted a bunch of people). But anyway, knowing people were out was enough to get me out. Beers and interesting times and new friends. I got home and I was totally exhausted, so I went to bed.<br /><br />I slept 11 hours. I was asleep for 11 hours. All at one time. I never sleep that long. I'm so used to four or five hours and exhaustion, I've go it down to an art. I feel so much better today. It's awesome. <br /><br />There will be photos eventually. As soon as I get off my lazy ass and download the card that's been in the camera since I came back from santa fe. <br /><br />Now: welding, car repair and fun times.
