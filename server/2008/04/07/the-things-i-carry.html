  <h2>The things I carry...</h2>
  So, because I have nothing to blog about right now, I thought I'd blog about what I think of as my adventure kit (edit: Yes, it's a purse, no, that doesn't bother me. A;though the wallet and keys and such are in my pockets, not in the bag). It's a bag I carry almost everywhere, and has all of my essentials.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I always have my camera, an EOS 5D, and the 50mm 1.2 lens mounted, excellent for us nocturnal beasts. Also pictured is the utilitarian 24-105, which keeps me from having to carry five fixed lenses, god bless it. In the column of camera stuff, there's also the waterproof card wallet and the extra battery.<br /><br />There's also the mundane stuff: A metal wallet, cell phone, swiss army knife, pens, notebook, tiny flashlight, business cards (the black thing on the wallet is my business card holder). A tin of altoids for breath.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least is the Nokia N800, which is a gadget, I'll admit, but I stay on top of email with it, and it's a lot lighter than a laptop. It does everything a bigger computer does, only smaller. Now if someone would just help me figure out how to easily get the RAW files from my camera out to small jpegs for blogging, I'd hardly need a laptop at all.<br /><br />And what do I carry it all in? I'm glad you asked. This is the Emsquared Super Adventure Plus 2.0 camera bag, with kevlar strap, in handsome gray fabric.  The ESAP features a main compartment of 9x4.5x6.5, with three subdivider pockets for organization. Seriously, I knocked this together last night.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I like it, but it needs some breaking in. Which I'm going to go do now.
