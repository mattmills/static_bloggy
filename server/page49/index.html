	  fuck it. I was going to write something but instead I cut it because let's face it, even I don't want to listen to my bullshit long enough to write it. The photos, though, I could stare at for hours... not that I do, you think I have time for that? no, I'm to busy doing your mothers. All of them, alphabetically. I'm all the way to 'c' now. Enough bullshit, time for the love:<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Random ass night at the hell house. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >More hell house, in the kitchen.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >The real hell cat?</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Yeah, alien spaceship shit, because I roll like that.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Or just the inside of the concert hall.

	  1. Getting ready for the first Oklahoma Citizen meeting wednesday-yes, the newspaper has a name, tentatively. I need to make an agenda, decide what I'm going to say, maybe put together a powerpoint, etc. etc. It's a lot of prep work.<br /><br />2. Laundry- I wore one clean sock today and one dirty sock. Enough said. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />3. House Cleaning- literally. My room has once more transformed into a series of piles, and the bathroom hasn't been scrubbed in a couple weeks. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />4. Physical therapy exercises- these take about ten minutes, and I'll probably do them right after I get done writing this. <br /><br />5. Promote <a href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/909837">my book</a>. Done. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />6. Process some of the pictures from the last few weeks. (The ones you're seeing here are from just after halloween. I have a bunch still in the camera from after that even). <br /><br />And that's it. My todo list for right now. What I should be doing. Instead, I'm waiting on a phone call to go out and celebrate somebody's birthday. No names, I am a gentleman after all. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/11/05/whats-next.html">what's next?</a></h2>
	  this is always on my mind. For a very long time, I've been casting about, trying to find my way through the world, and it's been a ripping good time. I've got a good job now, one that will eventually afford me a great deal of freedom, assuming I don't get tied down with a wife and kids and mortgage and all the trappings of modern life that are really just a trap. <br /><br />It's a curve though. I'm starting at zero: zero knowledge of the stuff I'm doing, zero time to do anything but sleep and work, zero money, and zero photos taken since I started the job on tuesday. these will all help each other though: As I learn the job, I'll have more time to get out and do things; as soon as I have a paycheck, I'll have more money in hand than I've had in months; and of course, there will be more photos. (I just checked; there are a couple photos on the camera, but nothing of consequence). <br /><br />one thing, I guess: I've realized that you don't have to be all one thing; that is, you can do a lot of different things, do them well, and it's not that you're letting go of one thing for another, it's that you're able to do both, and that all of your activities inform one another. It's a good thing I've come to this realization, because it's a really bad time to be trying to make money off of photography. (I'm not going to go into details, but someone was pissed at me recently because they thought I was putting out a certain photo for a profit, and it made me laugh. I've never made money off of what I consider my real work, the portraits, the documentary projects, etc).
