	  So I'm at my uncle's house in texas right now, and we were all sitting outside and I was shooting some long exposures of people, and pat says something to the effect of "Doesn't matter how fancy your camera is, you need some light."<br /><br />So, I keep shooting. I get this:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog705-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog705-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Obviously not the camera. It's the fake mustache on the front.

	  first of all, my thumb is fine. I lost a chunk of skin, that's all. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/arts/design/24isla.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">This is hilarious.</a> <br /><br /><a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/galleries/split_second/">Barbra Probst</a> on her photos of the same subject, same instant, from many perspectives. Her comment about not caring about what's in the pictures so much as how they're taken is bullshit, and a good example of why you don't have to listen to what the artist says all the time. It's a cool idea, though, and the photos are really interesting, so go look.<br /><br />And as for my photography, I've finally realized what I need to do. I'm at a bit of a creative dead end, not knowing what to do for a while. So, I'm gonna bust with the white seamless (see <a href="http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=0&a=0&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=7&at=0">Richard Avedon</a>) to get the juices flowing again. I even have a model in mind, if she's free next weekend. now, to the shower.

	  Rule #13: Never place your hand or fingers or any part of your body between any metal fittings or components. Use a tool instead. Click <a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0701-1.jpg">here</a> to see why. (Warning: Kinda Gross).<br /><br />After that, after dressing the wound, after putting in the new part, the car is still jumping into 1st gear. When it fails completely, I'm getting new wheels.

	  Feelin' kinda lost tonight, folks. Outside, far away from where I want to be. Half the world, in fact. I dream of running under the desert sun, under fire, not knowing what will happen next or if I will be alive to see it. It's the very edge of everything, chaos, terror, horror, and I really want to go and see it for myself. To take pictures and send them back to people in their calm normal existences, and maybe someone will wake up. <br /><br />The crazy thing is, I can do that. Six months, I'll have the money to go anywhere in the world long enough to make contacts and pictures and sell them and really start a career. It's wild and it's crazy and I'm going to do it. <br /><br />The weird thing, why I'm lost: I'm not where I want to be, but I don't mind where I am. I have a good job, good money, lots of friends. The climate here sucks, and the scenery  is mostly the clouds, but it isn't a bad place. I could hang around here and make a decent life, find some little thing with enough curves and brain cells to keep us entertained, make this job into a career with some law school, and have a good, happy time. <br /><br />I could do that, a nice stable life. Fuck that though. Why be normal when I can live a dream? Why do average when I can do whatever I want? Hotter women, more languages, more danger, more life. Feel every breath, see every person, love them all. Keep shooting and keep shooting until my light goes out. <br /><br />OK, not lost any more. Time to sleep.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/06/26/hi-boss.html">hi, boss.</a></h2>
	  And hi all the other people. Here's the deal: you can look at the pictures, ignore the writing, and probably get 75% of the good stuff I've put up here. (Theres this <a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/blog/2008/04/destructive-dissassembly.html">one thing</a> I'm proud of, nothing else comes to mind).<br /><br />So yeah, my boss found this site, and called me a serious blogger, and made some joke about terrorism. I don't don't know what that's supposed to mean... I don't think I've ever written about my politics here, and I don't think blowing shit up helps anybody, no matter who's doing it. <br /><br />Really though, there are some serious bloggers out there, but I'm not one. I'm a dilletante, too busy to go hunting links or shit. I just throw up my photos for people to see, tell some stories now and again, lather, rinse, repeat. I don't spell check or proofread, except the casual glances I give my html to see if it'll work. <br /><br />Today was an exceptionally good day though. I went and got some coffee from coffee slingers, which is this trendy place downtown, but they are really good at the whole coffee thing. I had one 12 oz cup and I felt amazing all day. Really good. I felt like a human being, with all the social graces and instincts and quick wit that I sometimes can muster, all from a little paper cup. Like whoa. <br /><br />Got up a little late, thinking I had a shorter drive, but I ended up having to go all the way to (censored). 2 hours. I then shot 3 whole pictures, emailed them to the person chaining the title, and waited a little bit because he said he might need something else. He didn't call, so on I went to (censored), an hour and a half away. Shot for the whole afternoon, didn't do too bad, 500 photos. My half-day record is 1000, whole day is 1800, and I had to get a wrist brace for my right because those days were right together and it's still a little sore. <br /><br />That coffee was really something though. High-test, I'm calling it in my head, like they used to call high octane gas. Better stuff. Makes everything run smoother, more powerful. We'll see tomorrow if it was a fluke or what.
