	  <p>Just a couple of the photos, too good not to share. Damn that was a long day&#8230; brunch, little kids, mcnellie&#8217;s xmas party, and then the after party. No wonder I&#8217;m exhausted all the time. Seriously I&#8217;ve gotta do something about that. Sleep more probably.</p>

	  <p>So yeah, this was also a couple weeks ago. I think it was the sunday after christmas. Pretty sure, in fact. Jen made pumpkin pancakes, which were awesome. Other things happened, pictured below. Bobby skating. Porch sitting. Big B lookin like the big G with the sunlight coming from behind him. Canon on his lap though, and we all know canons are the devil&#8217;s camera. (this is another case of me either being funny or unintelligible. I don&#8217;t care which).</p>

	  <p>Went to this show on a monday, sometime before christmas. The poor first guy had almost nobody there&#8230; I think his mom was taking pictures at one point, while the rest of us were off in the bar area, waiting for Rico Muerte to play. He wasn&#8217;t bad, except all of his songs were about his girlfriend. Then RM came on, solid rock, then some dudes from savannah with way too much gear but decent sound and then I left before it was over because some of us have to work at 8:30 in the morning. I&#8217;m not happy about it, but that&#8217;s the way it is.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2010/12/30/a-moment.html">a moment</a></h2>
	  <p>Sometimes there&#8217;s a moment when I see something and I realize the world is changing; we say things are different now but it doesn&#8217;t really affect the mood in my head, but then I see something like this guy hanging down from the broadway extension to do god knows what maintenance, and something clicks. Hundreds of feet in the air like some kind of hero, just doing his job. Not &#8216;everyday hero&#8217; but &#8216;this wasn&#8217;t possible before&#8217;; something outside my personal mythos. And then for a while my thoughts are colored by the fact the the world is bigger and stranger than even I thought; and that&#8217;s saying something.</p>

	  <p>For some reason, I&#8217;m still a month behind, although I am slowly but surely catching up. Sarah, a couple days after thanksgiving, invited me to her family&#8217;s late-giving, which they&#8217;d delayed so she could make it. It was nice, and then the next day we went to friendsgiving, which I didn&#8217;t really take pictures of because I was too busy stuffing my face.</p>
