  <h2>It's been seven days since...</h2>
  I took all these photos. Ok, in that last post, where I said I hadn't taken any good ones of Ali when we were celebrating her bday? I lied. There's one here that I really like and another that's all right, but it's not her face. What else? That was a dfry night, which is becoming more and more common now that blue note has changed the jukebox. My favorite bar is changing owners very soon... this has happened once before, and that change brought us ladies night and free pool afternoons, but we lost good show coming out of there, so maybe this time we'll keep the free beer and get back some awesome shows. <br /><br />Then there are the two pictures in here that aren't portraits. I'm becoming more impulsive with my photography, and that off ramp was an extreme example. I glanced out of the bar door, saw something, and had a compulsion to go out and shoot it. That's all I came up with; although there are several frames, I only like that one. What else? Holly, you'd better be treating my hat well. Regular walks, exercise, hand wash only. Now I have to get photos off the camera. <br /> <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0043.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0044.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0045.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0046.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0047.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0048.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0049.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0050.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0051.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0052.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
