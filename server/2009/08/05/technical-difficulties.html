  <h2>Technical difficulties...</h2>
  For those of you paying attention, there has been a little hiatus, a delay, a mini vacation even... Partly because of work, and the interruption to my sleep schedule, but also partly because it seems like I pick up every little bug that comes along since my accident. I felt like death for 48 hours, and I still have something of a sore throat, but I think I'm going to be all right. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />These pics are from Monday; Lori texted me from work, asking me to get people up there, so I did; <a href="http://www.furburger.org">Christa</a> and Jonathan came out and had drinks. It's sort of a hellish job, working in a karaoke bar; I hope Lori gets something else soon. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, I like my new job so far. It's actually challenging to steam milk. I still don't really have a grasp of what I'm really doing, but that will come in time. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And for those of you that have read this far down, a surprise: Booze cruise is happening this Friday, 9pm. The plan is to do two rounds at each bar, so we can keep some kind of momentum. Starting at the rooster, have a couple pitchers, then to the drunken fry, because I really want to try that truffle shit, and then to nancy's, so we can all get banned from yet another karaoke bar. I'm going to be annoying everyone in my phone/twitter followers about this too for the next couple days, hopefully enough people come out. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
