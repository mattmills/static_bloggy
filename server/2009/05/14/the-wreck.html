  <h2>the wreck</h2>
  since I've told this about twenty times yesterday and today, and a lot of those tellings were under the influence of strong drugs, i figure one more time won't hurt.<br /><br />i was riding my bike into town on 4th street and a car <span >t-boned me</span> hit me from the rear. The lady said she was singing to her kids. my lights were on, and i'd bet they weren't looking. I can't remember any of what happened. paramedics said the car was pretty messed up, but they also noticed I had my lights on. at least the car didn't run off. <br /><br />they took me to ou med center, where they determined I have a spinal fracture but no damage to my spinal cord. bruised ribs, some cuts, and my right ankle is stiff. I'm alive and I'll heal, which is the good news. i'm going to be laid up for a while though, have to wear a torso brace for 6 weeks. <br /><br />everybody's been awesome, thanks for all the support, food, books, and just dropping in to visit. I'm here till tomorrow at least, then home and more rest. pills. no bike for a while. if you want to get in touch but don't have my number, just send me a direct message on twitter. laters.<br /><br />(Edit to fix how the accident happened, I was more bruised on one side than the other, making me think I was t-boned).
