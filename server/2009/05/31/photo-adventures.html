  <h2>photo adventures</h2>
  This is from the rest of the last batch of processing. Traci (last picture) came and rescued me from my stircrazyness on Friday, whereupon we went downtown and walked around, lots of fun things to see around that time of day, just as work is getting out. Then there was sauced pizza and a norman party, where everybody thought my brace was fake until I told them the story. Getting out again, I've told that same story 20 million times. hopefully I'm done telling it now, but I have a feeling I won't be able to stop until I'm done wearing the brace.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >My dad, playing with the dog.
