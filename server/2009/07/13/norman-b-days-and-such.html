  <h2>Norman B-day's and such</h2>
  another round of drinking and photos... this was one of those nights that sort of blurred together towards the end... really fun, though, and I woke up in time to head off the hangover with water. Protip: Water works best before you actually feel the hangover. If you already have a headache, you're going to suffer more. <br /><br />Anyway, I rode my bike to get down there, 20 miles in 2.3 hours... terrible time, I know, but I did it, and that's the important part. There was a lot of terror and panic, and anger at everything with four wheels, but it's all part of the show at this point. I've just got to recondition myself, and that's going to take time. How long before I can ride ten miles in half an hour again? I don't know, probably a while. How long before I don't flinch every time a car passes is more important, and hopefully that'll be sooner. Pain and fatigue I can deal with, fear is harder.<br /><br />Less seriously, though, the night was a blast. 2 hours of bike riding to get to 6 hours of party=8 good hours. For example:<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Fabulous shoes.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >B-Bell in classic black and white.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Birthday Girl Shelby.

No, I actually think they were headbutting or something.
