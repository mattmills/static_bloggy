  <h2>Photo Walk</h2>
  The 4th was a good night; I ended up sort of all over the place, first riding my bike to a party right on the river in Tulsa, and then catching a ride out to the sticks for a huge bash in a field (this being the 4th, and it being oklahoma, nobody's day is complete without going out into the middle of nowhere and Blowing Shit Up). <br /><br />We get there and there's a $10 cover per head. Then we stand in line for beer for half an hour for 3.2 bud light. Then, just as I'm tweeting about how a fight would be a nice mood lifter, it starts to rain. So, the people who have tents run for them, and the people who don't run for their cars. I'm not lying when I say that I probably had a better time sitting in that car listening to music and talking than I would have getting obliterated and setting fire to the whole party. <br /><br />Then we bailed and headed back to Tim's apartment, where everybody just crashed. Which meant that my bike was across downtown from me when I woke up in the morning, so of course, I went to get it. I didn't <span >have to</span> walk, I could have waited for a ride to pick it up, but the walk appealed to me. And then there were photos:<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0008.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0009.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0010.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0011.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0012.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0013.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0014.jpg" alt="Photos" />
