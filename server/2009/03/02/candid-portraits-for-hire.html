  <h2>Candid Portraits for Hire</h2>
  <img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />So, this is a New Idea. At least, I think it's new, and if it isn't, well, I don't know anybody that does it. The idea is, a lot of people like to have good pictures of their family; in fact, this is the only thing a lot of people care to have pictures of. But studio pictures from places like walmart or sears or even glamour shots suck.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />So instead of a studio, what about the home? And instead of a quick grin-and-grab, what about spending some time with the family, say two hours- over dinner, maybe, or an afternoon in the park? Candid pictures the whole time, and give the family digital copies that they can do whatever they want with? If they want to order prints through me, that's fine, but I'd rather make money shooting than printing, so that's where the charges come from.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />The pictures here in this post were shot in the space of about an hour and a half; These aren't all of the keepers, just enough for a teaser. I ended up sending the family 25 images in all, all of which I was happy with.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />So, if anyone is interested in this being done with their family, just drop me a line at my email, rates are negotiable, and depend on how much and what you want me to do.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
