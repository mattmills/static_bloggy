	  <h2><a href="/2009/06/30/pride-parade.html">Pride Parade</a></h2>
	  So, it's pride 09. I wasn't on, but these I like. For those who don't know: I'm straight. And I'm not going to lie, this was mostly about being a part of the spectacle and drinking and cooking out for me. But yes, I do support a whole range of gay rights, marriage and equal protection and other things. But this was a party on wheels. <br /><br />I'd like to say the big fail is because of the lack of intimacy with the subject(true), or sub-standard camera equipment(not true), but really it was because I lacked two things: focus and a camera strap. I wasn't focused on taking pictures, more on riding the new bike, and I didn't have a strap to hold the camera so I was constantly death gripping it and worried I would drop it. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Two days before, but already started at the Copa.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >The Bike Horde.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was something about people wearing leather and being gay? Not sure. update from my friend hope who Knows Things: "The picture at the pride parade the people in leather. Its the national leather association. that's what the blue and black flag with the red heart represents. its a BDSM community with a very strong Gay following. I know i always have the strangest information. but there you go."</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This really surprised me; Dell is a big company, glad to see that they were out there in support.

The pride pictures are mostly edited, they'll be along sometime soon.

	  I said at the time on twitter, that I wished for a wider lens, but really I think these aren't bad at all. A camera that can shoot sequences would be nice, and I could have shot more varied things with more lenses, but I think sometimes limitations can drive creativity, and that's what happened here.<br /><br />For everybody that's tired of Tulsa pictures and posts, don't worry, I've got one more small post and then it's back to OKC pictures. And yeah, I could have put up all these pictures at once, but would you have looked as much at them, seen them as well? Anyway, there'll be a lot of pictures from pride parade hopefully, and I've a few from this week too. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0027.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0028.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0029.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0030.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0031.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0032.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0033.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0034.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0035.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0036.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0037.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0038.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0039.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>

	  SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY... was when I took these. Sunday morning, mostly, although the car show was in the afternoon. i really wasn't that impressed visually with the cars... i liked their style, I thought the work was impressive, but visually to me cars are just a big dead thing in the frame. If I'd been reporting on the car show, I would have picked out little details, but as it was I was just walking around with Rachel and Gretchen, all of us trying not to die in the heat. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0005.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0006.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0007.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0008.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Coming soon (after I take a nap to kill the hangover): The skate sessions.
