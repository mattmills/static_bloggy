	  I'm sure there will eventually be a part two to this, but my stomach started disagreeing with me, and is only now, a day and a half later, finally settling down. So I only played one game, and only shot two of them, and then I ran off to drink (see previous post). Anyway, here's the goods:<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/27/start-with-ladies-night.html">Start with ladies' night</a></h2>
	  <span class="caption"  >"I have something in my nose? What?"</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So, It's very early on friday morning, and I have about three posts in the queue. They're all vaguely about drinking, and/or bikes, and or insightful important need-to-know information. Those are the only types of posts I do, so we'll see if I can do them all in one feel swoop.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Sigrid was there, writing on people's knuckles.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Wednesday was the famous and ever popular ladies night at The Blue Note, and really it was a nice time. I walked in and there was Cyrus, chillin' at the bar with a new 'dew. I actually like the new hair better, even though it is a little funny to see Cyrus in a crew cut. I laughed, I admit it.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >For example: Reaghan.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />We were the two drunks at the end of the bar solving the world's problems. We came to the conclusion that people are better taken individually than in groups- there's some context missing, but that's what I remembered hung over this morning. That and a lot of pretty girls. Which brings me to the next part of the story. (You people reading this should realize that this narrative has a pretty good basis in fact, but I'm glossing over the boring parts of the evening).<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Then Cyrus upstaged all this knuckle writing by doing his whole forearm.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />New girl comes over, Jordan, we meet, get to talking, and it turns out she wants to be a Suicide Girl, but needs a photographer. I was, of course, doing my normal thing, taking drunkpictures at the bar, and so she asked me if I would do it, and me being an idiot, a sucker for a pretty lady, I said sure. So it's me and Cyrus and her hanging out and drinking, and one thing leads to another, and they're kind of talking, and then I look over and they're making out. Making out pictures don't do anything for me, but I snap a few anyway, because the impulse to document is still there.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Like I said, making out pictures don't do anything for me, but I love her surprised smile in this picture.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So I turn to Rachel, who was sitting at out table, and say something, chit chat like, and then Jordan says "Matt!" and pulls up her shirt. Reflexes and impulses being what they are, I snapped a couple frames. Demand all you want, but I'm not going to post that on the internet unless she tells me to, which is unlikely.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Does this look like a girl who would flash the camera for fun and profit? I like it, either way.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />From there, the night is a blur of the HiLo and then to Reaghan's new abode, where there was this somewhat interesting other girl, but then everybody passed out pretty quick, and nothing happened. Her name was Kat, I'm pretty sure, and I remember her asking about my camera earlier in the night. Maybe I'll run into her again. If not, it's the bus theory of meeting women. I'll let you work that one out while I'm working on the next post.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Walking back to my car, there was a random tractor. But that's oklahoma.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/27/always-remember-the-super-glue.html">Always remember the super glue</a></h2>
	  <span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />So, tonight, during the course of bike polo, and well before I'd arrived, Timmy wacked the back of his head against a concrete pillar. Whe I first saw it, I thought it wasn't that bad, but after a second look, I realized the wound, while small, was all the way through the skin and really needed some kind of closure. I jokingly said I could stitch it up if we could find a needle and thread. <br /><br />Now, I do have some pretty good first aid training and experience under my belt, so when Timmy actually wanted me to stitch it up, I thought, ok, no problem, told him it would hurt, but we could do it. So we all went back to grant's house, and we got out a needle and thread, I sterilized it in bleach, and we waited for grant to get back from the store with some peroxide to clean out the wound. Before you even think it, yes, I know that peroxide robs the tissue of oxygen, but iodine is harder to get in the middle of the night. <br /><br />We all go into the dining room and I lay down a towel and pour in the disinfectant. It's a little cut, but it really needed like two stitches to close it and keep out infection. It wasn't going to close on its own. So, I stick the needle in. It goes through with a little pushing, and then refuses to come out the other side. So I pull it out, bend the needle some more, and try again. Still no joy; the point is just too dull.<br /><br />We talk about taking him to a doc-in-a-box clinic, and Grant is looking up phone numbers when somebody brings up the possibility of super glue. I don't remember who, but I'm still kicking myself for not thinking of it before I tried to stitch him up. It's perfect for little out of the way wounds that need to be closed but can't be sutured for whatever reason (lack of insurance and sharp needles this time). So, Grant goes to the store again, gets some super glue, and the cut is fixed up better than the ER would have done in about five seconds.<br /><br />Moral of the story: Don't forget the super glue.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/25/twitter-thoughts-too-long-for-twitter.html">twitter thoughts too long for twitter</a></h2>
	  A conversation today on twitter got me to thinking about photography, and culture and style and art and society. There was a photographer, who shall remain nameless to protect the innocent, who's work really demonstrates all that's wrong with the world right now. <br /><br />The photographer that brought up all these questions is a very successful commercial photographer. Very polished, styled images. There are a lot of things that I don't like about them. A lot of his images are super low contrast, with no blacks (tonality, not people) at all, while also cropping off body parts willy-nilly. His lighting also bothers me- the photos strike me as the kind you need an army of assistants (well, at least two or three) to maintain-complex and unnatural. Not every shot should be into the light, all of them can't be at golden hour, and sweat is never that perfectly placed. It's a distinctive look, but it's a plastic look, it's one I've seen a thousand times before. <br /><br />We live in a dissafected, disenfranchised society. There are the indebted, and there are the people we owe money to. The rich are few and far between, something like 5% of the population at any given time, depending on your definition of rich. Money as we think of it now has no basis in the real world, but is merely some numbers in digital domains. <br /><br />Given that, where is art? It's all gold and glam and crazy hair and tight pants. It's abstract and disconnected and complex. It's thin, insubstantial. It's going to fall apart. <br /><br />It's the lack of substance that I keep coming back to in my thinking; those photographs, even of somewhat interesting subjects, were plastic and boring, stamped out of a mill of complicated lights and staged action-peaks that only look like decisive moments. They are the shiny object, to be consumed and tossed away without thought. <br /><br />Where are the real photographs, the photographers of the world as it is? I'm not talking about people wandering to far flung regions to uncover the the worst of the worst, I'm talking about the local people, the ones doing projects and reporting on local things? Where are these photographers? They're out there, I'm sure it's not just me laboring under a delusion. I know because I'm one of 'em.

	  Yeah, sure, sappy, I know. Go fuck yourself. My mom is in the hospital for the 13th time since September. Or was it August? I can't remember when she started dialysis, but it was around then. 3 A.V. fistulas, a peritoneal port, 6 cardiac caths, a couple infections, surgeries to install and remove the above, time for monitoring, recovering, etc, etc. She's been through a lot. And she's still not done, although it now seems that they've got a handle on why the fistulas keep failing so consistently, it's a 2% of the population kind of problem. Now she's going to rest for a couple months and they're going to do something different for a dialysis access. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >She might murder me for posting this, but oh well, at least then I won't have to worry about my student loans. This was right before they took her back for surgery today.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mom/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/23/home-where-the-laptop-is.html">Home, where the laptop is</a></h2>
	  <span class="caption" >Phil the wonderdog, and his owner Todd.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So, it was a fairly disastrous weekend, with a few redeeming moments that made the trip to Austin just shy of a total waste. So I blogged about Thursday evening, and then took my laptop into the kitchen for some browsing and conversation. I plugged in the laptop so it could charge, and then when I got up I tripped over the cord and knocked it onto the floor, breaking the screen. So, sans laptop, I didn't blog or process pictures the rest of the weekend. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Steves was there, somewhat improbably.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />That afternoon, there was an alley cat and a movie premiere. I got DFL in the alley cat, and saw half the movie, which looked pretty good, and then decided to strike out towards the action. There were free drinks somewhere, I could smell them. Come to think of it, that might have been the empty beer in my hand. Oh well. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >The bikes piled up before the alleycat. Yay dfl!</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />That night, my luck was a little better. We got in to a party with free tequila, but then, standing in a long line waiting for drinks, Sarah decdided to go see Devo, who I don't care about, and so we all left the party with the free booze and I went and walked sixth street for a couple hours while they were at the show. That's where I saw the coolest thing of the whole trip. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There was a guy standing between two van de graaff (lightning) generators, all covered in chainmail. The lightning striking him was modulated so that the lightning was a speaker. The lightning noise was the music.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >F'ing amazing.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />From there, I wandered until my feet hurt, then sat a little, then wandered a little, in a "diminishing returns" situation until I was walking a block and sitting on a curb for five minutes, and then getting up and moving along. Somewhere in there was pizza and a coke. Then Devo was over, and everyone went back to the party with the free drinks, where, after I'd had one beer and one shot of tequila, they ran out of booze.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Back at the house to sleep, only to wake up in the morning to no computer and no internets. Saturday was half-decent DJ's during the day followed by a rather nice evening hanging with Todd (my host, remember) and his girlfriend Kelli. Fairly interesting people, the both of them. Todd really really needs to show his paintings in a gallery. I know people, professional art people (gallery people), who would kill for paintings like his.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Oh yeah, <a href="http://www.furburger.org">cmay</a> was there too.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Sunday morning, we woke up and drove back. Contained in that sentence was another highlight of the trip- driving north on I-35, big puffy clouds overhead, radiohead on the stereo, and finally, for a little while, everything was right with the world. Now I'm home. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >People at the "Mess with Texas" show right next to the capitol. This was a nice moment when I was sitting on a rock.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
