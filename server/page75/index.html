	  <h2><a href="/2009/02/10/a-weekend-in-kentucky.html">a weekend in kentucky</a></h2>
	  So I started my new job for reals last weekend, and it was strange, like everything else in my life. The traveling was some of the easiest I've done. Nothing went wrong (in an unfixable way, at least). Like I said, the things that are usually difficult, like morning coffee or lunch, were handled with ease. For those not in the know: my new job is taking pictures of dance competitions. to the tune of 20k images a weekend.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/louisville/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />The hard part wasn't really taking the photos, either, although I can tell already that my timing and camera handling is going to get a lot better (this coming from someone who didn't think that was possible). This is a good thing.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/louisville/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />(There was some bs here that I cut out, because some shit shouldn't see the light of day. not while it's half baked at least. suffice to say that dance competitions are hard to fit into my worldview; they are, in a word, problematic). <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/louisville/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />At the end of the day, the girls probably mostly have a great time dancing, and enjoy having quality pictures of what they love doing. I can dig on that. Thinking of it that way, it's hard to hold onto my objections. At the end of the day, I'm a professional. I do the job, nobody gets hurt because of it, maybe some people enjoy what I produce even. That's fine with me.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/02/07/the-abbreviated-quest-for-coffee.html">The abbreviated quest for coffee</a></h2>
	  So I woke up at about 4:30 this morning, local time. I sat around for a little bit, then decided to get my ass in gear and shower and clean off two days of road dirt and sleep. Every time I needed something, there it was in my bag. Even Q-tips, even my phone charger. <br /><br />So, fresh, dressed, I pulled out my laptop and read a bunch of feeds, all the usual blogs. At this point I thought I'd try to go and find coffee, usually an exercise frought with difficulty not least because of my level of awareness. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/abbrcoffee/0010.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br />Out the room door and down the stairs of the convenient downtown hotel. and into the lobby. I already knew that the continental breakfast didn't start until 7am on saturday (seriously, the majority of travel is business and on the weekend; some people have to be out the door earlier). I had little hope, then, of finding coffee in the lobby. I found the usual breakfast nook empty, per expectations, but as I was snapping a photo of it, the desk clerk came around the corner and I asked her: Where can I get coffee?<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/abbrcoffee/0011.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br />That angel, that wonderful woman, told me that she was making it right then, that it would be out momentarily. F'ing amazing. So I stood around for a minute or two, then she came back with an airpot. Awesome. <br /><br />That's this trip so far in a nutshell. I'm a professional working with professionals. Everybody's doing their job, there haven't been any disasters yet. (As I type that I knock the wood of the desk). And today, I get to the best part; for six or eight hours, I'm going to sit in a chair and take pictures. <br /><br />It's not enough; I'm still gonna have to push my own work, keep making my own pictures, but it's a start. I think I'm gonna like this job.

	  First off, I'm writing this in a bit of a rush, scratching off that last to do item from my list before I hit the door. The Regular Wednesday sesh was a lot of fun; not only did we hit the litter box, but we rode around and hit some spots as well. Down by the chase building, a little bricktown love, and then we rocked up the monster hill. It's the only monster in town, another sign that OKC isn't a real city. Anyway, photos:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I love how everyone's starting to get the no handed shit down pat, or at least look good for the thirtieth of a second I need to get the photos. Nice to see hornbeck in town, too, and on his new whip no less.<br /><br />So anyway, that's all folks, I'm out. I'm going to try to shoot and post from the road, we'll see how well that works. I'll be twittering, at least. On the flip side.

	  This is where I want to live when I grow up:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thst/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />This will be my corner store. Wait, are those apartments above that store? Can I change my mind about the house thing? Awesome. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thst/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" />

	  no time to post thouroughly, but topic for later: why the hell aren't we doing our dream jobs? Or busting ass to work towards them? Not allowed to use the words "in these difficult economic times" or anything of the like. The time to do that shit is now, easy or hard.

	  But the volume knob <a href="http://paulsboutique.beastieboys.com">here</a> is pretty badass. Actually yesterday I was talking mad shit on flash for web design because it usually sucks and just does the same stuff that you can do faster and better in javascript... but this I have no idea how I'd do, and it's a cool effect.
