	  just to frustrate the people waiting for KRONDOR pictures. Don't worry, I'm onto that next, I'm even skipping the openbeta stuff to get to it. But anyway: <br /><br />The Science Museum (their real name, no kidding) here in the city has a little exhibit on antique bicycles, or the development of the bike, or something like that. Really cool, I want two of everything they have on display. including that steam powered bike. that's pretty rad. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Lori looks at an original boneshaker.

	  <span class="caption" >This dude's name was Izzy. I think.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0023.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />So, I was just riding my bike around, the middle of the night being the best time for it, and I happened to turn down in to a neighborhood. I thought maybe there would be a way through to the next block, and sometimes there are even people out on their porches, partying, and that's always good for a drink or two. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >This chick put on an awesome impromptu set. I'd listen to her again, even buy a cd, if I knew who she was of if she had recordings. Anybody know? edit to add: several people have told me that this is Ali harter. Thanks.<br /></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0024.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I couldn't have been more wrong. I mean, the neighborhood was all dead end cul de sacs and turned in on itself- the way I came in was the only way in or out. It was <span >quiet</span>, too. Like zombie movie quiet, all the houses dark, not even a television flickering that I saw. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Ed and Victoria.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0025.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I kept cruising, slowly, looking for some sign of life. I was about to give up and leave the neighborhood, and three big dogs jumped out of their doghouse, running and barking. Then, I saw the fence between me and them, and pressed down the little panic reflex. Not wanting to push my luck, I got the hell out of that weird neighborhood.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Katie, no metal face.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0026.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />And then I found five dollars. (Not really, but Alex told me to say that when I tell a story that has no real point, so people don't feel cheated for reading it). <br /><br /><span class="caption" >I think he name is Meg? (edit: jennifer. not even close there, bub. ther real question: where do I know a meg zinkly?). Cool chick, does good designs.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0027.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>
