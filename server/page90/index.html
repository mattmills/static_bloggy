	  Went back to Paseo arts fest yesterday, met up with some more new cool kids, lots of fixed gear riders. Glad to see some community here around cycles. A lot of the kids seem genuinely cool. <br /><br />PS- sorry the post yesterday was so incoherent. spillover from the crazy week. Photos!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0525-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0525-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0525-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0525-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

	  because there's dudes out there keepin it real, reality being important as it's all we have. That's not true, we have imagination too, angels have wings because they take themselves lightly, so we must do the same if we hope to fly. I'm rambling drunk if you can't tell.<br /><br />Just took a nice ride over to Sauced, the bike and dog friendly hippyish pizza place just north of 23rd. Good pizza, ran into some kids, one who I think I knew from somewhere, but unfortunately he was an asshole and wouldn't talk to me. He happened to have photos, but they were terribly cliche, super white girl in black underwear with a gas mask, black and white, you know, art school special. but then this other dude turned out to be cool, rides fixed gear, works in a shop here, knows the scene pretty well. appearently there are a couple bike gangs. Who knew? Alleycat next week too. So that'll be fun. <br /><br />Let's see. Had some work stuff which I'm not going to talk about, because unfortunately, my job has some confidentiality required. But it was handled quickly and efficiently once I went over to my bosses house, the man has connections, and I'll leave it at that. Lucky for all of us, and I have a feeling it would have been me taking shit for it if he hadn't worked it out. Then again, he got to know all the people he knows by being a really nice guy, so who knows?<br /><br />Looking forward to going to the paseo arts fest tomorrow. I'll probably bike over. It's another day in paradise, and I get to sleep in. Peace.

	  good times though. I like my new job. Lots of driving. Lots of seeing different places.  I shot more pictures in a week than I did in the six months before. unfortunately, they're all terribly boring, but fortunately, it pays well. Or will. First payday isn't  until the first. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0521-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0521-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />There were some tings I was going to say, but because of sleep deprivation, I've forgotten them. Oh yeah, that's what I wanted to talk about. Seriously, a 16 hour day followed by a 20-hour day with four hours sleep in between isn't for the amateurs. I'm afraid I haven't been terribly coherent or socially acceptable, but hey, who needs that at work? <br /><br />Seriously though, if anybody who's seen me in the last couple days stumbles on this, I'm really all right most of the time, but my short term memory goes to shit when I don't sleep. And since what little social grace I have doesn't come naturally, the mental energy I normally use to interact goes more toward remaining upright and breathing and such. For some reason, I can do photography until I pass out. And have.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />With this post, this blog is officially longer than my old one, payingoffmyloans. And while I had that blog, I didn't pay on my loans at all. I thought about finances a lot, mostly because I was always broke, and the conclusion I came to was that I needed more income. <br /><br />Also, for the first time met someone in the real world who'd read this before I knew them. I have a link in my email sig to the main site, and he saw this. And there was a weird moment when I thought, what did I put up there that I wouldn't want him to see, and I really couldn't think of a thing. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Life is good.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/05/15/interesting-times.html">interesting times...</a></h2>
	  Despite the dark cloud of unemployment and impending insolvency, I've been remarkably up this weekend, mostly because I think I finally got out of the hole of a job I was in. The money was too good to give it up but not good enough to set aside what I thought of it, of the whole situation. I was a sell out, and I really hate that I did that even for a little while. Of course, I needed that period of transition to get out of the stupid funk I was in after coming back to oklahoma. A little distance for a little clarity, time to think without impending doom, etc.<br /><br />Silver linings, right? In disaster lies opportunity, phoenix has to burn first, etc, etc. I hope.<br /><br />I might have told you, but there are two versions of the story of hope in the greek mythos. This is before the great greek philosophers went and clogged western thought for the next few millennia. Anyway, they say Pandora opened her box and let out all the evils in the world. Curiosity, they say, and they're not the only ones to blame all the world's ills on curiosity or women (although I think the former gets us into more trouble). Well the two versions are different because of where hope comes from at the end. In one telling, it  is the last feeble curse to flap out of the box. In the other, the gods take pity on us poor dumb humans and give us hope, to make up for all the cruelty and misery and nonsense that they gave us. (A box that can never be opened? Totally a set up. Pandora is innocent!)<br /><br />Sometimes I believe the former, sometimes the latter. Sometimes hope is the only thing that keeps a fool like me going, and sometimes it is the only thing that leads me to do the things that I know are right and good. It has, a couple of times, caused me to fall on my face. I feel better having fallen than I would if I'd stayed at home, though. <br /><br />Pictures later, when I have something to post.

	  Let's see, it's been a while since I rapped at ya'... like before last saturday, I think. I can count how much sleep I've had since then on my fingers and toes. 1+4+4+2+4=15 hours since noon friday. It's amazing how quickly it catches up with you. Stupid insomnia.<br /><br />So yeah, Denver was nice. I finally got the burrito I've been craving, from illegal pete's. Met this really cool gay nurse. I would have loved to talk to him a little more, because he knew a lot about medical things I'm curious about but never had anyone to ask. Like he knew a new thing for me to try for my insomnia, a protein called theanine.<br /><br />Yeah, then I got on a plane and came home, slept four hous and then drove an hour and a half to get to work. Work was easy and good and they're paying, which is so huge of a plus I'm going to be in the black eventually.<br /><br />Pictures:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
