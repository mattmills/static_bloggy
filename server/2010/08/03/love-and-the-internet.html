  <h2>love and the internet</h2>
  <p>Love, man, that&#8217;s a tough one. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense. <a href="http://xkcd.com/55/">My normal approach is useless here</a>. Not that I&#8217;d try to do math on it, but it&#8217;s definitely one of those areas where <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/what-i-learned-in-college-the-world-doesnt-make-any-sense/4153727?productTrackingContext=search_results/search_shelf/center/1">the world doesn&#8217;t make any sense</a>. Is is bad that all of my thoughts can be summed up in links? the best, though, is the blockquote <a href="http://blog.tonypierce.com/2010/08/lost-bet-and-had-to-watch-bachelorette.html">from tony pierce</a>:<br />
	<blockquote>but when it comes to love, real love, long lasting forever and ever love, the type of love that means everything, and fuels everything, and creates magic that last for generations &#8211; well that love is worth climbing every mountain and fording through every stream.</p>
<p>that love is worth putting your perspective partner through every test and exercise, and more importantly yourself through tough questions and tougher actions</p>
<p>which sometimes means you&#8217;ll be alone for a while.</p>
<p>miles davis was known for his amazing music</p>
<p>but i will submit that it was the silence in between the notes that made him legendary.</p>
<p>as depeche mode once suggested</p>
<p>enjoy the silence.</p>
<p>and pray for those who sleep on couches, those who propose on tv, and especially those who struggle with change.</blockquote></p>
<p>Some notes: I&#8217;ve decided, with the help of my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/thedauthi">@thedauthi</a> on twitter that there is an <span class="caps">XKCD</span> for anything nerd related. Also, that book was something I did my sophomore year in college, and you shouldn&#8217;t buy it. Buy <a href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/909837">this one</a> instead. And always listen to the Blogfather about love.</p>
