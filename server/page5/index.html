	  <h2><a href="/2011/04/25/waiting.html">waiting</a></h2>
	  <p>Right now, I&#8217;m at work, on lunch, just sort of waiting for it to be over. When I have lunch here in the office (microwaved something-or-other) it only takes ten minutes, as opposed to the hour or hour and a half going out somewhere usually takes. And it&#8217;s cheaper, less than a buck for a sandwich and gatorade. And since there are only a couple decent restaurants in edmond anyway, I&#8217;m not missing much. The problem is, I&#8217;ve now got 50 minutes to kill. Luckily, I have a blog to write for&#8230;</p>
<p>The photo is about waiting, too. Leia here was waiting for a phone call, to go and pick her boyfriend up. It&#8217;s complicated if you go deeper than that as far as details, but I like the photo anyway.</p>

	  <p>
Went to bartlesville again, two weeks ago? three? I'm thinking three. And when I go to bartlesville, there is some madness. In no particular order: A broken cell phone. Divorce. Drinking. driving. A puppy that I couldn't keep, for now. Inappropriate jokes at 9am that were funny for all by 9:05. 
</p><p>
And then, a delicious, calm breakfast from Heather, and an nice tranquil couple hours sitting around shooting the shit. Then we drove home.

	  <p>
So a lot of my friends have kids. Sometimes, they're around, or sometimes I'm around, whatever. But those individual pictures don't really fit with photos from bars, photos from parties, of drinking, etc. If there's anyone out there who only knows me through this blog, they might think that that's all I do, but the truth is a little more complicated. Anyway, what was the point of all that? 
</p><p>
Oh yeah, photos of my friends' kids. next post there's going to be a cute puppy too. See? I'm not one sided (at least I can lie to myself).

	  <p>well, this is a first. I'm up at 5 am, really awake at this hour for the first time in years. had a good day yesterday, and I'm planning on having another one today. I had a date, too, and I've got another one of those coming today, too. If you ever hear me complaining about my life, feel free to tell me to fuck off. (Now, that's different than bitching about oklahoma, which is as much a pastime here as bitching about the weather...)</p>

	  <p>I walked towards mcnellies, and I noticed the steam rising; and I thought, "If the shadows hold and I can get that steam, that'd be a good picture." So I tried a couple exposures, and it worked. i think this means I'm going to be all right, photographically.
