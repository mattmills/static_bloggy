	  Orphans: Brawlers, bawlers and bastards. It's a mix of amazing things that blow my mind and amazing things that creep up behind me and hit me over the head and totally unbelievable things that really can't be said but can only be heard. Really, if you're too poor to afford this album, go steal it. It's easy enough, and totally worth going to jail over. <br /><br />On the good news front, I've got everything I need for work on tuesday. Laundry is washing, to get me ready for a flight tomorrow. I'm going to Denver for some tests to get into a study. The upshot is I get free blood pressure meds, free monitoring of a kidney problem I've got, and a free plane ride every so often. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_kidney_disease">Polysystic Kidney Disease</a> (adpkd) is what I've got. In my family the onset is a little earlier than average. My aunt had renal failure at 48, my uncle in his early forties, my grandmother at 46 or so (I don't know exactly because she wasn't born yet). My mom, and this is the good news, is 51 and is six months to a year from going on dialysis (they usually start dialysis before total kidney failure, at 15-20%). <br /><br />I've known about this since I was about 16. I was having headaches, went to the doc, he diagnosed me with high blood pressure and because of my history ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis. So, I know that in about 27 years I'm going to get really stuck and tied-down (in dialysis) if not just plain dead. <br /><br />It's OK. I have a plan, and yes, I know how it ends, six feet under. It's what happens between now and then that makes a difference. I've just gotta burn hotter, faster, and better than the rest, that's all.<br /><br />Let's see, I've been emailing with Lora over the past few days. I was pissed, and I let her know about it. I've gotten over being pissed, and we're finally talking, which is an improvement. <br /><br />New  <a href="http://www.adorama.com/ICAS5.html">camera</a> hotness, just for my job. It'll do. Anyway, more pictures later, when I'm done looking at today's take.<br /><br />Tom Waits is now God, replacing Virginia Woolf.

	  so I can't sleep. stupid insomnia. The pure awesome in the title is all the good things that happened to me today. The hard drive issue was resolved, and now I have more storage on board my laptop. unfortunately, I don't have any music any more. <br /><br />Also in the good news column, Dillon called to give me a heads up that his boss would be calling to give me a job with his company. And then his boss called and I've got the job. Which means I won't be joining the apprenticeship after all, and I'll be making almost three times what I would have anyway.  I GOT A JOB DOING PHOTOGRAPHY! YAY! That alone is enough to make my day. But then....<br /><br />The I decided to go out and celebrate, and Dillon says, meet me at the blue note, and oh yeah, Joanna's in town. SoI try to go to the blue note, only I get lost, then I find a gas station with a phone book, then I go to the address and there is the bar. And the Voodoo Glow Skulls were playing! Yay! They rocked so hard and so loud the air got thick, the mosh pit was so intense I was dizzy just shooting pics of it. Anyway, these are my to selects, I'm going to go try to sleep now. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

	  <h2><a href="/2008/05/07/no-photos-this-time.html">no photos this time...</a></h2>
	  and thereÅ› a good reason for that actually. My pecious MacbookÂ´s hard dive died. I maen, like,  really dead. Making bac clicking and hig pitched grinding noises, dead. So Im blogging from the handheld while a new install of mac osx is working. Luckily for me, I have a ton of hard drives sort of laying around. I spent about half of last night (when I was supposed to go out and have a beer) trying to download and install <a href=http://www.ubuntu.org>Ubuntu</a>, but for some reason the install disk didnÂ´t work in either my momÂ´Å› laptop or mine. Then, while I was trying to find a 6-pin to 4-pin firewire adapter, I found the restore disks for my current laptop, which Id assumed were gone forever. By then it was 3qam though, and so I went to sleep. Which explains why Im doing an install in the afternoon.<br /><br />Had My interview to be a plumber yesterday. It went pretty well, although I shouldnÂ´t have mentioned my photography, for some reason the guys doing the interview couldntÂ´understand how someone could be two things at once. The answer, of course, is very carefully if at all. <br /><br />WeÂ´Äºl see. I got 10th on the list and 8 have already been called, which means IÂ´m #2 on the list right now. I dont really want to go out as a plumbing apprentice. Seems boring. Welding on the other hand is the magic that holds the world together, quite literally. The interview for that is tomorrow. I know what not to say this time too.

	  not really. I just feel good because I'm drunk. oh, drunkblogging. and making up words.<br /><br />So I went out to the bar tonight to celebrate the <a href="http://www.gestaltnews.com">first issue</a> and I sit at the bar next to these two chicks, Melodi and Kat, all decked out prettylike and pretty soon we're talking and I'm like whoa hold on and I run out to the car to get my camera.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />So, I get back in and I'm like "Can I get a picture?" and they're like sure, no problem, so I get a couple snaps. Then I hit the head, and make the obligatory self portrait. hey, hanging around Alex nursed my nascent narcissism.  I'm an alliterative drunk. With a spell checker. <br /><br />Anyway, I come back out, realize I'm out of money, and I head home, right after I make another pic of the hotchicks and random dude. Then I got home, thought for a second, grabbed a pack of smokes, and went back, only to find the hotchicks had left. And if any of us hadn't been broke we'd all still be drinking. Last call is right about now in most places in this town. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Oh yeah, the reason I'm still drunk is there's this bottle of wine on my desk, you see. It was helping me do javascript last night and earlier today, and that didn't kill it, but I'm about to. I know that sounds like an alcoholic talking but really I don;t drink that much. It is fun when I do though. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Also, I just found <a href="www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a> which is maybe the most amazing thing on the internet ever. I jumped up and down and scared my cat when I realized what it is. You get to catalogue your books and find people with the same stuff/interests. WOW. And the wine is gone and there are pics to edit for this post. Hope everyone is out there having as good a time as I've been having.

	  and that's not really a bad thing. <a href="http://www.getstaltnews.com/">Gestalt</a> is up and running with its beta issue. The gallery is some nifty javascript which needs just a little tweaking to be really wonderful. There are a lot of things I'd like to get fixed before the next issue, mostly more content. I don't really like the headline font now, although it seemed perfect three weeks ago when we picked it. Google ads aren't online yet. For anyone who'd like to contribute a story, just <a href="mailto:mail@gestaltnews.com">email me</a>. Ok, now I gotta get away from the computer. Later

	  I'm typing this up from the handheld, watching a movie. It's a little weird, but it'll do.<br /><br />I've been thinking about my photography, about how I tend to be blurry a lot. The thing is, I'm constantly trying to not be blurry. Fast lenses, fast ISO, steady hands. The problem is life is blurry sometiems, it moves very fast, is fleeting, never stops.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />There was a storm today, looked like it might produce a tornado right over my house. There I am in the miiddle of the road, takng pictures, mom yelling at me to come inside. So, after watching for another minute, I did. The truth is though that I would have stayed out there and watched the storm. There wasn't any real danger, just hailstones. The tornadoes all touched down a mile east of here, really small ones. We did get some pretty big hail though. and then another storm in the night.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />It's funny how things work out sometimes. I really wanted to write a post earlier today about how excellent and wonderful girls can be sometimes, even while they're exasperating, but the energy's all gon out of me. maybe later. but things are good, the house is still here, and I'm still talking to everyone. Gestalt is going to happen, even if we only have five pieces in our first issue.
