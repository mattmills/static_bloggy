	  <p>Because I have this thing about making the page not get too slow to load, and because I feel like people look the individual images better when there aren&#8217;t 21232283 pictures to look at, the NMF stuff will be broken up a bit. This is the first night, second or third show. 
<br/><br/>
I feel like if I were really to describe my life, I&#8217;d be another <a href="http://www.number27.org/today.php" target="_blank">johnathan harris</a>, it&#8217;s so weird and wonderful and straight up surreal. <br/><br/>Anyway, evidence:

	  <p>So, Amber was kind enough to let me and Chas and her bro crash at her house, even leaving the front door open so we didn&#8217;t have to leave the party when she did. The next morning, Amber and josh and I had brunch at the Norman Airport. It&#8217;s a place to go to based on novelty, because the service sucked and the food wasn&#8217;t even as good as ihop.

	  <p>I&#8217;ve been doing this thing now for the past couple weeks, when I see a cloud that I like, for whatever reason, I take a picture. Clouds are the ultimate transients. Impossible to pin down. The way the light plays on them is so <i>dramatic</i>, as if they have moods. 
<br/><br/>
Anyway, I&#8217;m thinking of using these for a show I have coming up. I know, I&#8217;m becoming that pretentious asshole I never wanted to become. Whatever, I&#8217;ll probably come up with something better like 48 hours before the show and rush around getting it done in the nick of time. <br/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0009.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0010.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0011.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0012.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/></p>

	  <p>And by pre-gaming, I mean I went to a show, to warm me up for all the other shows. I could have used a drink, as this was a TV taping and all those cameras made me kinda nervous, but after a couple takes I got used to them and was able just to enjoy the music. 
<br/><br/>
Why I was there exactly is a little complicated- a friend is a PA or something for the show, and I ran into her when I was in Stillwater a couple months ago at a show, and she asked me to do some stills for them, so I did. And I guess as a thank-you and because they needed warm bodies in the seats, I got to go to the on set taping of the show, Warehouse something or other.

I&#8217;m kinda in love with what that lens can do.

	  <p>Today is a weird ass day&#8230; I keep doing that thing you&#8217;re supposed to do in lucid dreams where you look at everything twice, to tell if I&#8217;m awake or not. Man, people in the hospital, (everyone is fine now as far as I know) sudden revelations, breakfast tacos, madness.  
<br/><br/>
Yesterday, I lost my voice. I said to Reaghan: &#8220;I took a shot of Tom Waits,&#8221; because when I could talk, that&#8217;s who I sounded like. This morning, eating my taco, I heard in my head his reading of Bukowski&#8217;s poem &#8220;Nirvana&#8221;: &#8220;Not much chance. Completely cut loose from purpose&#8230;&#8221; Oh the <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-have-an-ipodin-my-mind,10912/" target="_blank">ipod of the mind</a>. 
<br/><br/>
Anyway, here are some entirely unrelated photos:
