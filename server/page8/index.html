	  <p>just a couple photos&#8230; got a bunch more in the queue. It&#8217;s amazing how far behind you get when you start a month behind and then lose the use of your laptop for a week and a half. But enough excuses. I&#8217;m working on a bunch of things&#8230; couple photo shoots coming up hopefully, coding some interesting side projects. I have to wonder: is the extra mental energy spent on coding a drain on my photography? I think it is. If nothing else, there&#8217;s only so much time in a day. I don&#8217;t sleep much. Oh well. That&#8217;s what the coffee obsession is for.</p>
<p>Speaking of, this was a really enlightening day. It was down at Elemental&#8217;s new Alley Bar, which is, as I&#8217;ve written before, pretty amazing. I learned a lot about espresso blending and what exactly goes into it. A lot of coffee was drank. One blend had the distinct flavor of peanut shells, I&#8217;ll never forget it. But the real blend, what we came out with, was amazing. Lots of complexity and goodness. I wish more coffee shops in town used Elemental. Actually, scratch that: I wish less shops in town used Neighbors. I wish some of them would actually taste good coffee and think about what they&#8217;re serving. &lt;/rant&gt; Anyway, this was a pleasure. They&#8217;re open limited hours in the mornings right now, but totally worth getting up a little early to get to.</p>

	  <p>It&#8217;s been a long week and a half actually. Broken laptop and hospital time and exhaustion and stress. But on the other hand: drinking and good times and great friends and new beautiful women. really, I&#8217;ll take what I can get. and now I&#8217;m back on the air, everybody&#8217;s healthy (knock on wood) and my lappy is more or less restored. Done and done. <br />

	  <p>Taking photos of skaters is weird. I was doing it today, again, and really, it&#8217;s a completely different thing from photographing other kinds of athletes or doing regular portraits. It requires you to be very close to the action- you&#8217;ve got to be careful not to make yourself an obstacle while being in the middle of things, basically. Anyway, yeah. I&#8217;ve been off the last month. not shooting as well as I usually do. I&#8217;ll get it sorted. I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s just the winter blues, which usually go away as things warm up.</p>

	  <p>Not about these photos, which are decent. I&#8217;m going to a rally today, in solidarity with the people in wisconsin. It&#8217;s another one of those moments in history. Revolutions across the world. Protests here in the US. People who are nostalgic for the late 60&#8217;s, wake up and get your ases down to the capitol. It&#8217;s a good time to be alive. And it is Oklahoma. Not a lot likely to happen here. (I know I just jinxed myself. The knowing negates it). But still, anything can happen. Anyway, enjoy the photos and pay attention to twitter for updates on the ground.</p>
<p>(edit: decided I didn&#8217;t like that first photo. poof! like it was never there). <br />

	  <p>well, I opened this tab yesterday, and the dream I was going to write about has pretty much evaporated from my memory. Oh well. The first photo is from elemental, at there new shop, the first morning they were open&#8230; it was sort of beautiful how thin their operation was, and how well it worked. There was one woman with a square reader taking credit cards, and one barista making amazing espresso drinks. It&#8217;s gottena bit better now, even&#8230; I think they have heat in their building, and some more furniture. Really exciting to see a new business start up an do so well.</p>
<p>the rest of the photos are the usual fare, from a night out at blue note.</p>

	  <p>This shit was a blast. seriously a lot of fun. As in, we&#8217;re going to have to do it again. Thanks to (in no particular order): Amber (hair and makeup), Brian (lights/grip), KJ, and Meghan (models). Anyway, yeah. Photos. I&#8217;m splitting this into two posts to ease the server load.
