	  <p>so, this was a hell of an epic brunch. Back when the thunder was still playing, I think. I find myself in picasso&#8217;s most sundays, because a) they&#8217;re close, and b) they&#8217;re awesome. It&#8217;s the kind of place you can meet a girl for the first time to kick off something amazing (photos to come on that one), meet your friends hungover, or take your mom for mother&#8217;s day. I&#8217;ve done all that in the past month there. It&#8217;s always a good time. This one was especially good, what with the thunder win and the pretty girls and plentiful mimosas. The epitome of a Picasso&#8217;s brunch.</p>

	  <p>I just pushed the better part of a month&#8217;s photos up to the server, and there&#8217;s a whole metric fuckton (bigger than a standard fuckton, you know) of stories to tell. Some of which I can&#8217;t tell, because a gentleman doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>You all know neighbor Traci? Love neighbor Traci (that&#8217;s an order). She&#8217;s one of the friends that I&#8217;m fantastically lucky to have around. This was at the other room about a month ago, some random saturday. So a bunch of us were drinking, and somebody pulls out these fake glasses. You can&#8217;t tell because of the light, but they&#8217;re those yellow-tinted lenses. And Traci is just goofing off, being her usual silly self. Always cracks me up.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2011/05/30/mini-shoot.html">mini shoot right before the real fashion show</a></h2>
	  <p>So right before we all left for the plaza district, another photographer that was there took some of the girls out to shoot, and I sort of butted in and shot a few things too. Couldn&#8217;t help myself. Anyway, good photos. Now I have a chore to take care of. Don&#8217;t tell anyone, but I&#8217;m making little 4&#215;6 prints of the actual fashion show to give to the girls and or their stylists.</p>

	  <p>Velvet monkey puts on an annual fashion show at their Plaza district location, and a couple people I know were modeling and since I&#8217;m friends with a few of the stylists, I went and did some behind the scenes shooting at the downtown location while they were getting ready. Some good concepts, some good looks, pretty fun overall. I&#8217;ve got another post coming where we did a little guerilla shoot in the street, those&#8217;ll be up sometime tomorrow.</p>
