	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/20/sxsw-update.html">SXSW update....</a></h2>
	  So we're still here, still haven't seen any shows, and if it weren't for our gracious and intelligent host, we wouldn't even have had and free beer. Austin is really going to have to kick it up a notch to save itself from this one. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Beginning of the night, all dressed up, still hopeful.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />We went to the party 45 minutes early and there was already a line a couple hundred people long. For some reason, when you tell people free beer and hot DJ's, they line up like it's the cure for stupidity. And then stand there. For two hours. While people cut, and get to go in vip. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >On the way, the night looked promising.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Seems to me it's an intelligence test. It sounds like a good idea to go stand in line for a little while and get a bunch of free shit- booze, music, hot, scantily clad women etc. There's a limit to how much you can stand there though, and here's where the intelligence test comes in: the smarter you are, the sooner you leave. When we left, there were still 200 people standing in line, not about to get in. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >The line, when we got there. Seemed like we'd get in.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Now, they were at capacity when they stopped letting people in, I'm sure. But after a bunch of people leave, why not let the people at the front of the line in? Instead, they were only allowing VIP's, which unfortunately, we're not. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >The same line, 45 minutes later.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />So, we gave up after about an hour of just standing there. In our defense, there were maybe 20 people in front of us; it seemed possible, when they said they were at capacity, that we might get in after some people left. Then we came back to the house, (Todd's house) and drank beer and talked late into the night with todd, todd's friend who works for SNL, and his girlfriend, who's name I've forgotten. Longtime blogreaders and friends will know this is because I'm horrible with names.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was as far as we got. Then we gave up and commenced drinking.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos"/>

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/19/in-austin-on-a-couch.html">In austin. on a couch.</a></h2>
	  <img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />So, throwing yourself at the mercy of the universe occasionally does work out. I'm on a couch here in Austin, TX, mere miles from downtown and the famous and ever popular SXSW music fest. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />The whole journey started this morning, when Sarah twittered about going to SXSW today, to catch some band. So I called her and asked if she could delay an extra half hour, to give me time to get my shit together ( I thought we were leaving tomorrow). She told me she didn't really have shit together either, and so I had time, meet at her house, and everything would be cool. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />It took for-ev-er to get out of OKC though- one thing after another kept going wrong, or errands that should have taken just a few minutes took an hour, and on and on. It was like the karmic forces of the city didn't want to let us go. Finally, after something like 2 hours of running around, we were ready to go. <br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />The drive down was good- there was a nice sunset, some McD's, a little nap, and not a few pictures. I drove the last 40 minutes, and after a couple tries, parallel parked the car on an off street east of downtown. We got on our bikes, and not two minutes later were yelled at by some cops. Nice job austin PD, making people new in town feel welcome. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />So, jetting away from that situation (nice thing about bikes in a city- there's little chance for someone in a car to catch you), we found ourselves right in the middle of the maddness, on the mainline, we hit the central nerve, etc, etc. Only to be greeted by a sign outside all the official venues: no photography without a press pass. Bullshit I say. The good news is that for the most part we're going to be frequenting unofficial parties and venues; apparently that's where the best parts are. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Went from there to the long branch, which was a cool little joint. Nice atmos, good music, interesting clientele (if you could call them that). I had a couple beers, and that (and a short ride back to the car, and a short car ride) brings me to the present tense. Oh yeah, and there's a crazy jumpy dog in the house we're staying at. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos"/>

	  Ended up at sauced friday, and didn't have time to post these yesterday. some people might say that makes me a bad blogger, but they need to get a life. The band is called, I think, The Double Clutchers. I could tell they were having fun, not a bad sound, but a lot of covers. I enjoyed it.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />This girl is not a member of the band. Rule of thumb: stripes = trouble. She's not wearing paisley, that's all I'm sayin'. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
