	  <h2><a href="/2009/05/31/old-photos.html">old photos..</a></h2>
	  since I've had to resort to shooting film, I had to get it processed, and there was this random roll that has been on my printer stand for a while, so I had it done as well. These are from the end of spring 2006, at the annual Doc Studies barbecue. Looking at this old work, I couldn't help but notice how different it is, and how much higher a percentage of misses I had back then, even with the same camera & lens.  <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Two of the graduating seniors.</span><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Professors standing around.

	  I forgot my cf cards, and so I had to improvise and use my phone camera to take a few pictures. It was a very zen experience shooting this way, with complete simplicity. I was able to concentrate soley on the images.  you only have one button to push, and that's it. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I was sitting there, at sauced, at Haley's booth, and I was watching all the ametures with their digital rebels, and I realized that the difference between them and the professionals I had worked around and with was principally one of concentration. The pros are zeroed in on what they are doing, the only thing in the world for them is the viewfinder. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Matty from the Rodchenko(sp?) angle. </span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />On a completely different note, I found a really cool company called Elphel building the open source camera I dreamed up last year. they sell a bunch of boards that could theoretically turn any old 35mm film camera into a digital camera, in either black and white or color. Their examples kinda suck, and I suspect it has something to do with the tone curves they're using, but if I can get the parts and get it to spit out 16 bit raw data, I would be one happy matt mills. For the nerds: <a href="http://www3.elphel.com/">Elphel's web site</a>. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/05/25/its-630-and-im-still-up-time-to-give-up-on-sleep.html">it's 6:30 and I'm still up. time to give up on sleep?</a></h2>
	  (note: where I say today, I'm mostly talking about sunday, as I started writing this at about 5am monday morning, thinking still as if "today" were sunday. It's a total brain dump/rant, but there's a lot of good tidbits, anyway).<br /><br />I can't sleep. Maybe if I write everything down that's on my mind, I can get some peace and rest. <br /><br />The lawyer situation: I've made the initial contact with someone who is supposed to be good, but may or may not know anything about bikes/bike law. I sent along the police report, descriptions of my injuries and the photo of the bike I put on twitter. So, on that, I'm waiting. <br /><br />Injuries: everything was better today, except for right after I woke up; moving around a little worked out the little bit of stiffness that I had, and the only thing that's bothered me all day has been my ankle, and that only in the last couple hours. For some reason, bad days seem to follow the good ones, and I'm more than a little afraid of waking up in agony. Maybe that's why I can't sleep. No pain pills today though, that's something. <br /><br />On the subject of pain pills, I'm somewhat divided, because on the one hand, they allow me to function on the bad days, at the worst moments, I can still get out of bed and move about the house, but I'm always a little hazy on those days, and it's nice to be clear. Would I just be in bed, suffering? Does pain by itself slow healing? When will I stop feeling like I've been hit by a car at 35mph?<br /><br />Questions for the doctor (appointment on the second): How long will it take me to recover? How much of a recovery can I expect to make? Am I permanently damaged? When can I get rid of the shell? Where is the break exactly? Can I see my X-rays? How much PT (physical therapy) will I need? <br /><br />Questions for the lawyer: How hard is this going to be? Is all of my stuff (bike, camera) covered? How much PT will I be able to afford? What about lost work time/income? <br /><br />I've got lists of things that I need and/or want; things that are missing, notably my passport and notebook and flask; lists that I don't know if I'll ever tick off all the items or not. How is it that despite being an invalid unable to drive or walk I have so much to accomplish? And the number of little side things on my mind, besides. For example: I have to get my car registered and licensed this week, and I'm thinking about either getting an iphone or fixing the netbook, but I don't really know which to do, and I can't do anything at all about these things till friday, which is when I get my last paycheck from OSU. The paycheck is a surprise, though. I'm glad for it, and that I'll be able to fix/do stuff once I get it. <br /><br />Then there's all the nice stuff people have done for me, from loaning books to bringing me beer to just coming over and hanging out and talking. I have a stack of comic books that I've read thanks to Cyrus and a bunch of DVDs that I've half watched on the nod, thanks to Adam M. I had the best cup of coffee I've ever tasted while I was still in the hospital thanks to Francois. I've got beer and good literature thanks to Stuart. I'm just now digging into the lit. Ken got me a freakin' camera, even if it is just on loan for a while. That's why there's still a trickle of pictures up here. I haven't forgotten any of you, and I'm trying to think of something nice to do, in gratitude, once I'm back on my feet.<br /><br />That's about it. I think I've gone from the surface to the deep parts of what's on my mind. If I wrote any more, I'd be telling my life story, as all the other thoughts I have are just snippets of anecdotes from disconnected stories.

	  I've never before actually needed to ride in one, but they say there's a first for everything. Today, I used one of those electric carts to get around sams. FYI, they're a pain when you have to use them. That and for some reason I kept getting dirty looks; I guess because I have the brace on under my shirt people thought I was a healthy person abusing the cart, if that were possible. Oh well.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/05/21/out-of-the-house.html">Out of the house</a></h2>
	  Went out last night. Did the whole blue note/ladies night thing. Tommy G came and picked me up, and off we went, into the night. It was nice to see some of the people out that I hadn't seen in two weeks. Of course, as sure as the night before, the morning after is a bitch. I woke up and I couldn't move, there was a lot of pain. I'm sure it was a combination of attempting to detox and the night out, but still, I'm glad the pain pills were within arms reach. <br /><br />So, as things stand, I still need to get a lawyer, I don't know if there's going to be long term damage, and I still don't have a job. Sometimes I need the pain pills and sometimes I don't. it seems to depend on what I've been doing more than anything; the easier I take it, the better off I am. <br /><br />On the good news list, I have a camera now, thanks to Ken's boss. It's a digi Rebel, nothing to write home about, but it's functional, at least, and I figure I could do worse. It's not like I have any assignments anyway. Project idea: Photograph all the stuff people have loaned/given me while convalescing. I might work on that after my nap. photos of last night to follow later too.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/05/17/fallout.html">fallout</a></h2>
	  I write this blog for two reasons, to share pictures and so all the people in my life, no matter how far flung, can get an idea of what's going on in my life. Now, since I had the wreck last tuesday, I've only posted once, just putting up some details and leaving it at that. Since then I've been popping pain pills at regular intervals and working my way through the stack of comic books and movies my friends brought by. Then someone bitches in the comments that I'm boring him. I told him to go fuck himself, because, hey, I deserve a couple days off for the broken back. <br /><br />On the other hand, I do have a few updates to pass along. I got out of the hospital Friday, and promptly took a nap. When I woke up I realized I hadn't looked at my camera in several days, so I pulled it out and found it was broken. My 50mm 1.2 won't autofocus and the mode dial no longer works at all. And the battery door is broken off. The bag I was carrying has a hole in it, too.<br /><br />It's hard to get up and down, but I can walk and stand pretty well, although that does depend on me keeping up with the pain pills- one every four hours and I can move and function pretty well. On the pain meds, I can do most normal stuff.<br /><br />I didn't take any before I went to sleep last night, mostly because I was feeling fine and I really don't like the drugged feeling. This morning, I was regretting that decision, because all of the minor aches had turned to major ones, and it was a task just to sit up in bed. I took pills, and now I'm fine. I can't wait for the day when I don't depend on pills to get around the house. Should be soon.
