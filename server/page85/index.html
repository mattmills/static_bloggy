	  <h2><a href="/2008/08/11/js-in-blogger.html">js in blogger</a></h2>
	  so anyway, if you want to do any javascript in blogger, you've gotta put in in your template, in the header, to make it work. as far as I can figure. could be I needed ADATA tags, but anyway, there's source now to embed a javascript gallery into blogger in the post below and the header of the blog. This is for people that have their own server space. All the functions are in the header, and the stuff in the post is function calls and definitions, how many photos and where to get them. File names go in the array, and if you name your photos 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg, etc, then you won't have to even change that.<br /><br />I had an awesome weekend though. Crazy coincidences, party, artshow/b-boys. 950 pictures saturday night/sunday morning. I danced! I talked to pretty girls, ran towards a fight, slept on a couch, and had brunch in style on sunday. shitty javascript too, fixed monday in 15 minutes of fresh coding on lunch. also some shitty food sometime before sunday evening made me miss soccer, not the brunch though, that was too soon. <br /><br />Some of the photos below are real keepers, as in they're going in my portfolio. Into the edit I'm doing now at least. I decided that I need the <a href="http://www.adorama.com/INKD700.html">D700</a> beacuse let's face it, I would have a lot less blurries at ISO 25000. and the focusing screen! so much better. It won't make me a better photographer, but it's one hell of a lot sharper knife to cut with, if you can dig it. <br /><br />Video of the sequence of b-boys coming whenever I get my shit together, maybe tomorrow. If it were my job I would have done it sunday. But my job is boring, dull, and unimaginative. Fuck it, I'm going to go do that now. Video before I sleep if it kills me tomorrow.

	  so, I'm bored. Not just a little bored, but epically madly stuck in a rut bored. Normally what I do when this happens is, well, something crazy, I take a trip or cut off my hair or have some brilliant idea and go off after it for a while. All of my options right now fall into two categories: the "I don't want to" and the "I really shouldn't."<br /><br />What I should do is edit the 7000 pictures I've shot since coming back here into some kind of portfolio. That's what I call a good start.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/08/04/out-with-the-old.html">out with the old</a></h2>
	  So sunday I finally gave up my old car for an even older car. My Mercury Sable has been with me for about three years, four or five girlfriends (I can never keep count) 60,000 miles, and a lot of good and bad times. Some of the bad times were when I had to piece it back together after it failed me, but that's only happened a few times; it's been remarkably reliable in the clutch. <br /><br />So this post goes out to all the miles and all the memories.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/07/30/must-post.html">must... post...</a></h2>
	  So anyway, I'm still alive. I've been uber responsible about sleeping and working and whatnot, and you know what it's gotten me? I'm about to go stir crazy. I stare at the empty soulless nature of my existence and wonder why the fuck I'm doing what I'm doing. I can do better. <br /><br />So tonight, I changed all that. I drove home from Mcalester, which is about two hours, and ate dinner and then rode out to sauced on the bike. (Yes, this is Oklahoma, there's only one bike and we all take turns). I knew I would be out too late to get any rest. I knew I should have probably finished processing the section I had finished shooting earlier. Screw working off the clock for no reason and screw rest. <br /><br />So I went, and I sat and drank a couple of beers that I didn't really have money for, called Alex, said happy late birthday to him (note to self: 22nd), and then people showed up, Haley and Erin and other dude, I should know his name, I know him but I cant remember his name. So we go for a ride, downtown, then we go back to sauced, chill only for a brief moment, then ride with erin home. Then the lightning started.<br /><br />So I booked it home in like 30 minutes, which is super fast for that trip for me. There 's this one long dark stretch of deserted road that 's either really awesome or really shitty, because it's dark and kind of lonely, but mostly that's a good thing for me right before I go home to all the comforts therein. Good for thinking. <br /><br />What I thought tonight is that when I make good, responsible, sensible decisions about what to do with myself, I'm unhappy, and when I do what I want to, I'm much happier. The punchline: My time is my time. There was more to this all, but I don't want to talk about the shitty day I had or why I was pissed. Stupid creditors.
