	  I still have a working pair of headphones. The new ones got ripped apart today. got dad his birthday gift, he liked it. What else? on the bad news list, I'm out of money, bills are due, and I'm back in oklahoma. So what else is new?

	  and other stuff, too. Arianna, and I have no idea why I got such a block about it. Actually, it could have to do with the emotional stress of the week and the madness therein. What else? I've been thinking about things to say on here and lots will occur when I'm out and about, but not a lot comes to me now. <br /><br />Definitely going to Egypt and Gaza in January. Actually, I'm only definitely going to Egypt, getting into Gaza is a matter of getting to know the right people once I'm on the ground, fining the right border guard to bribe, or a small row boat to row a few miles trough the blockade. Or any combination of the three above things. <br /><br />All of my backups are stale by a week now. If you don't know, this is a terrible thing. Although it's better than none at all, I need to run a full backup tonight. <br /><br />I bought new headphones today, both ears work, so that's good. Not much else to report. Money's low. more later if I get inspired of crazy or something.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/08/21/santa-fe-dreams.html">santa fe dreams</a></h2>
	  Still here. Had a really excellent dinner with Mike and Tina and their lovely daughter who's name I'm drawing a complete blank on. It'll come back to me. Really good food though, I've never had a bad meal there, and the company is extraordinary. It's always a treat. Then, I had a nice talk with (insert youngest daughter's name here, which I now have a major mental block around, even though we've known each other for a few years now) after Mike and Tina went to bed. It's really rare to find someone who I can really talk to, who has interesting things to say, etc. <br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-1.jpg" ></a><br /><br />So, in other news, I got kicked out of Alex's place the other night. Well, first I did a semi-pornographic shoot with Kit, which the roommates didn't like. I can't fathom what a bunch of hetero bachelors would find objectionable about a naked woman in the house, but that's just me. The shoot itself went really well, Kit is happy with the pictures, and you should be able to see them eventually on suicidegirls.com. Yeah, that classy porn site. If such an oxymoron is beyond your ken, sorry. (As an aside, this is the only way I'll do certain kinds of photography: nudes, weddings, and a few others, you have to be my friend first, and ask nicely. I'm likely to do it for free, though). <br /><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-2.jpg" ></a><br /><br />What else? Mad drama which is now solved and not worth talking about; staying in andrew's house; and the internet in the hospital is down, so I'm posting tethered to my phone. We blinged alex's walker. Chilled on the plaza. Lots of drinking in small portions, a beer here, a glass of wine there. I haven't been really drunk for several days, though. Now, Photos!

Alex is doing really well, considering the extent of his injury; broken pelvis and a cracked rib to boot would lay anybody up for a few days. Kit on the other hand, is just phenomenal. First of all, she seems about ten times hotter than when I last saw her, is taking care of Alex's every need, setting up a place for him to live and a way to get there and dealing with all the details of wrapping up his Santa Fe life. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0002.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0002.jpg" ></a><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0003.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0003.jpg" ></a><br />I'm doing little things, like driving, and craigs-listing the truck, but mostly I think I'm here to help everyone keep their shit together and lose it under the stress. I don't know how many times I've told Kit to breathe and "It'll be ok, we'll get it sorted," etc. And then there are the secret missions that i can't really talk about because they're secret and Alex reads this sometimes. You'll enjoy it Al, I swear. <br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0004.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0004.jpg" ></a><br />That's about it here so far. Catch you all later.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0005.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0005.jpg" ></a>

	  So I'm headed home today, and I get a call from Kit, and Alex is in the hospital. Broken pelvis. So I'm going to Santa Fe. Tomorrow I'll go out and see what I can do to help them, Alex and Kit, because they're some of my closest friends and really I'd be a terrible person if I didn't go do what I can. <br /><br />So for all of you OKC people, that's where I'll be for the next couple days/possibly a week or two. Catch you all when I get back. there might/should be updates here as things go; I'll have plenty of time for blogging.
