	  <p>between things, so a quick blog post&#8230; charging my phone, actually. Toured the Abita brewery while I was in Louisiana&#8230; that&#8217;s the crowd in the first photo. That&#8217;s Lane(y?) and Jeana sorta dancing at rock n&#8217; bowl in the second&#8230; and finishing off the night at some local bar in the third. I like that bars there don&#8217;t close except when the bartender feels like it. It lets the night flow much more naturally. Speaking of bars, my phone is charged enough to get me through the night and I&#8217;m off.</p>

	  <p>So this was a long stop motion video that I think they were going to set to music and have a video; and at then end they knocked it all down. This rings all sorts of bells for me as a critic and artist; it&#8217;s collaborative, impermanent, made for reproduction&#8230; things I like, more or less. But standing there, looking at it, most of it sucked; right as it was about to go somewhere interesting one or more of the parties involved would fuck it up. Come to think of it though, that&#8217;ll probably look pretty good on video.</p>

	  <p>christmas night, doin&#8217; it right. I may have been a little obnoxious in front of my friend&#8217;s wife (wife and friend in the first pic). It was the <span class="caps">DNR</span> talking, I swear. Anyway, yeah, onward and upward.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2011/01/18/welp-so-much-for-that-lens.html">welp, so much for that lens...</a></h2>
	  <p>I just spent the last hour putting the finishing touches on a repair that I started <a href="http://www.notuntitled.com/articles/2010/10/14/saga-of-the-lens/">way back when</a>. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s nothing physically wrong with the lens; I had it in <a href="http://instagr.am/p/BDQJn/">many pieces</a>, far enough into the guts to find any physical defect, and there were none. So, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong with the lens. It works fine in manual focus, and I&#8217;m tempted to sell it on ebay as such. then again, having a backup 50 is never a bad idea. Photo evidence (sorry for the crappy phone pic):</p>

<p>Up next: photos. seriously.</p>

	  <p>This was a pretty good time, even though they cut the party off at 1am. Went to this sketchy party and arrived just as the cops were leaving, said f this and headed to a friend&#8217;s house to dance till we got tired of it. Good times.</p>
