For the first couple of months here in the bay, you could find us at bar trivia at least once a week. It's a good way to get out of the house an dnot feel like you're just wasting time. I may have mentioned it on the social medias. Anyway, it's nice to sometimes win some beer some times (2 or 3 times, but who's counting?), and have a good excuse to go drink it.

Anyway, the bar we go to for trivia is just a stone's throw from the rockridge BART, which has a nice view of the bay, the bridge, and the city beyond. I seem to take a picture of it everytime I'm there, but they don't usually work. I do like this one, though.
