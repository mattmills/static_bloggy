Three verticals in one post? What is the world coming too?

Tonight's post is sponsored by Charlie Loyd actually sending out a newsletter and reminding me that I had a blog that I was neglecting. There have been many things afoot; a lot of busy evenings and late nights, my folks were just in town for 10 days, the new job is going like crazy, etc etc. But that's no excuse.

This was sometime after the new job started, if memory serves, but before the wedding (which, still editing those, and it is super hard to cut pictures, but here we are, limited by the format; I haven't ruled out doing 4-5 posts).

About once a week, I manage to take a long coffee break and go over to SFMOMA. Having a membership means I can get a ticket on my phone and walk right in for free, any time they're open. It's a quiet respite from the madness outside, and also from the work. I like the work I'm doing, but going to the museum puts me in a completely different headspace for the duration of the break. It's a complete luxury and I can't believe the place isn't mobbed with tech workers all the time.

Now, we could get into the case (fairly strong) that museums are institutions of the hetero-capitalist patriarchy, but that's another post. For now, I'm just happy there's a quiet, beautiful place this close to work.
