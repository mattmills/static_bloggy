<span class="caption" >Mesta park, rolling around, version 1.</span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/scannerday/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Mornings like this one are why I started carrying my laptop in the first place. everyone else is fast asleep, but I'm up, can't sleep, and so it works out that I should be here, typing. <br /><br />Yesterday was one hell of a day. I got up and made myself the perfect cup of coffee, Siracha coffee beans in the french press. Then I had another cup, the bottom of the pot, while I caught up on newsfeeds and twitter and all that. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >And then this is version 2.</span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/scannerday/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />While I was chatting with Grant, I had a brilliant idea: convert my used cd's into a radio scanner. What use is a scanner, you say? Information about what is going on. News as it happens. Things to take photos of. This particular conversion was by way of the used record store, so I grabbed all the ones that were worth anything, and started to head that direction.<br /><br />I got as far as my car, which I discovered was dead, and so I tried to start my other car (a mostly-broken mercury sable) and found that it too was dead. So I went back in the house, got my bike, and headed to the record store. <br /><br />I get to the shop, tell the lady I'm selling if she's buying, and she takes my stack of cd's to examine them and make me an offer.<br /><br />"$55?" the woman behind the counter offers, rejecting one. "Sure," I reply- it doesn't seem like enough, but I'm hoping to hit up a pawn shop and get lucky. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/scannerday/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So the first pawn shop I go to, I have to explain that no, a scanner isn't the same as a CB. They don't have anything. I'm ready to give up on the day at this point, but as my path took me down reno towards downtown, I passed another pawn shop, and stopped in to see. <br /><br />This was one of those slightly sketchy places, the kind that sells more guns and ammo than anything. That, and they have a large selection of used tools. I asked one of the guys behind the counter, did they have any scanners? He allows that they do, right this way. He one pulls down from a shelf which is mostly pistol ammo, a handheld that seems perfect. I turn it over and see the price: $69.99. He's gone off to ring up someone else, so I fiddle with it a bit, find out that it covers a ton of spectrum,and then when I get his attention, I ask him if he'll take 50 for it. He says yes, 50 plus tax, and so I say sold. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was pretty much the entire crowd the whole time I was at Uptown.</span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/scannerday/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />From there, I go to fourth street and ride into the city. Beatnix for lunch, and they really do have the best hot roast beef in town. If only they'd get sourdough bread, it'd be perfect. I sat there after my sandwich was finished, and programmed in all the frequencies that the public services us here in the city- something like 35 channels in all. Then I have business to do. <br /><br />The saga of the missing pictures continued with yours truly going to sauced and finding them still down, but Matty promised they'd be up by five, and that they were just moving things around, etc, etc. Which reminds me, I've gotta go back by there today and see what they put up, how it was done, and really if anything got done at all. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/scannerday/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I killed about two hours then, playing with my new radio in the park. The thing I've heard on that thing already are hilarious and interesting and I think it might work out to be a good thing.<br /><br />Dinner with Grant, Damaris, Timmy, Kolby, Erin, and this girl from Tulsa, can't think of her name, it might come to me later. Indian food, way out on 23rd street, really good, really filling. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Random dude. Every party needs at least one to liven things up.</span><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/scannerday/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then it was time to go to the dance party, only there wasn't much dancing or partying going on at uptown united. For most of the time I was there, there were more people chilling outside than inside dancing. And I do mean chilling. It got chilly for this correspondent; I was only wearing a t-shirt, though. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Timmy, passin' out.</span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/scannerday/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />After waiting an hour and drinking all of my beer, The party still wasn't really going, So I left, back to rendezvous with Timmy and some of the rest of the gang; we met at Grant's, and then went from there to the former bike cave, where there was much drinking and cards and dice, and pizza and passing out also. <br /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was the pizza part of the evening.</span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/scannerday/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >The dog even got some.</span><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/scannerday/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There. That was my friday. Now I'm going to try to pass out for a little while.
