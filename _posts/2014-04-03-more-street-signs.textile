I'm happy to report that my new camera arrived today, so I can keep boring you indefinitely with more photos... of course, that's not the point. I'm not myself without it; not just without the camera, but without the act of taking pictures. I get depressed, moody. Easily tired.

Someone asked me recently why I'm always taking photos, and I sort of drew a blank, like I always do. Then, they rescued me. "Do you do it just for the Art of it?" they said. Yes, that's exactly why I do it. That, and I can't not do it. I need to be taking pictures, in some fundamental way. Everything goes kind of flat and shitty when I'm not taking pictures regularly; it's as if the act of photographing turns the world up a notch.

Making photographs, making art, brings me joy, but not the kind sunshine and puppies and laughter kind. It’s more like water. It’s just not possible to go on without it. One is ephemeral, experiential. The other is hard and certain, something you make with your own hands. It is a sword that will cut god, a path to buddha-nature.

Enough already. Have some photos. Goodnight.
