I'm happy to report that my new camera arrived today, so I can keep boring you indefinitely with more photos... of course, that's not the point. I'm not myself without it; not just without the camera, but without the act of taking pictures. I get depressed, moody. Easily tired.

Someone asked me recently why I'm always taking photos, and I sort of drew a blank, like I always do. Then, they rescued me. "Do you do it just for the Art of it?" they said. Yes, that's exactly why I do it. That, and I can't not do it. I need to be taking pictures, in some fundamental way. Everything goes kind of flat and shitty when I'm not taking pictures regularly; it's as if the act of photographing turns the world up a notch.

Anyway, it's far too late. Again. I've already rewritten the above paragraph 3 times. Cut out "a reference to kill bill":https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=059RKcpkn8A#t=90 . Enough already.
