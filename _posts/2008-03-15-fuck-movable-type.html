Seriously. I've been dicking around with it for like two days, couldn't figure out how to customize the layout. I know nothing of PERL and really don't want to know. The reason I can't figure it out is mainly because the settings are all spread out over about 20 files, whereas with blogger, they're all in one spot. not to say blogger isn't a pain in the ass, and eventually I'm going to make my own template, but for the moment, it's blogger, and it'll look like this.
