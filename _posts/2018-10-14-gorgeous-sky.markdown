The first photo was taken 9 minutes before the second two. I think I like the third one best. There's something nice about the context provided by all those wires. Anyway. This post is just some pretty pictures. Hope your weekend is going well. I ran errands all day, put together a casserole to bake for brunch, and have been working on my welding technique this evening. Took a bunch of photos out of the edit that I don't like now. I suppose that's the danger of waiting a month. There's a likelihood I just won't care about a certain photo or even set of them when the time comes to post.

Anyway, there's today in the bag.
