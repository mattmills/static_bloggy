<p>Took a little road trip to the Wichita Mountains, which are nowhere near Wichita, Kansas, incidentally. Berlin (second photo) came along and took pictures too. You can see her photos form that day on her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessica_berlin/" target="_blank">flickr</a>. I finally got to try a meers burger, which was good, but their onion rings weren&#8217;t that great. Irma&#8217;s is better. It was a nice chill day to get away from the city and see some sights.  <br/><br/><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0053.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0055.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0056.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0057.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0059.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0060.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0061.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/></p>
