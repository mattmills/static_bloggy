Last night I went to the blue note, not expecting much after the thunder game. I got a nice surprise. The "Pretty Things Peep Show":http://www.prettythingsproductions.com was there, and I've gotta say they're one of the better acts I've seen. The MC, Donny Vomit, kept things lively. I wish I'd taken more photos. As it is, editing these was really difficult- I liked a lot of them. The bed of no nails was particularly funny/entertaining.
