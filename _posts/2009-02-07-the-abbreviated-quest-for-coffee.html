title: "The abbreviated quest for coffee"

So I woke up at about 4:30 this morning, local time. I sat around for a little bit, then decided to get my ass in gear and shower and clean off two days of road dirt and sleep. Every time I needed something, there it was in my bag. Even Q-tips, even my phone charger. <br /><br />So, fresh, dressed, I pulled out my laptop and read a bunch of feeds, all the usual blogs. At this point I thought I'd try to go and find coffee, usually an exercise frought with difficulty not least because of my level of awareness. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/abbrcoffee/0010.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br />Out the room door and down the stairs of the convenient downtown hotel. and into the lobby. I already knew that the continental breakfast didn't start until 7am on saturday (seriously, the majority of travel is business and on the weekend; some people have to be out the door earlier). I had little hope, then, of finding coffee in the lobby. I found the usual breakfast nook empty, per expectations, but as I was snapping a photo of it, the desk clerk came around the corner and I asked her: Where can I get coffee?<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/abbrcoffee/0011.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br />That angel, that wonderful woman, told me that she was making it right then, that it would be out momentarily. F'ing amazing. So I stood around for a minute or two, then she came back with an airpot. Awesome. <br /><br />That's this trip so far in a nutshell. I'm a professional working with professionals. Everybody's doing their job, there haven't been any disasters yet. (As I type that I knock the wood of the desk). And today, I get to the best part; for six or eight hours, I'm going to sit in a chair and take pictures. <br /><br />It's not enough; I'm still gonna have to push my own work, keep making my own pictures, but it's a start. I think I'm gonna like this job.
