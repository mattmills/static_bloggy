so I can't sleep. stupid insomnia. The pure awesome in the title is all the good things that happened to me today. The hard drive issue was resolved, and now I have more storage on board my laptop. unfortunately, I don't have any music any more. <br /><br />Also in the good news column, Dillon called to give me a heads up that his boss would be calling to give me a job with his company. And then his boss called and I've got the job. Which means I won't be joining the apprenticeship after all, and I'll be making almost three times what I would have anyway.  I GOT A JOB DOING PHOTOGRAPHY! YAY! That alone is enough to make my day. But then....<br /><br />The I decided to go out and celebrate, and Dillon says, meet me at the blue note, and oh yeah, Joanna's in town. SoI try to go to the blue note, only I get lost, then I find a gas station with a phone book, then I go to the address and there is the bar. And the Voodoo Glow Skulls were playing! Yay! They rocked so hard and so loud the air got thick, the mosh pit was so intense I was dizzy just shooting pics of it. Anyway, these are my to selects, I'm going to go try to sleep now. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
