From <a href="http://www.americansuburbx.com/2008/01/theory-interview-with-garry-winogrand.html">American Suburb X</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>Interviewer: If you don't like "street photographer," how do you respond to that other Ã¦tiresome phrase', "snapshot aesthetic"?<br /><br />Winogrand: I knew that was coming. That's another stupidity. The people who use the term don't even know the meaning. They use it to refer to photographs they believe are loosely organized, or casually made, whatever you want to call it. Whatever terms you like. The fact is, when they're talking about snapshots they're talking about the family album picture, which is one of the most precisely made photographs. Everybody's fifteen feet away and smiling. The sun is over the viewer's shoulder. That's when the picture is taken, always. It's one of the most carefully made photographs that ever happened. People are just dumb. They misunderstand.</blockquote><br /><br />You should read the whole thing.
