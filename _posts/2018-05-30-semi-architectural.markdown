Been doing this work for a while, and the other day Mike called it out on twitter as 'architectural stuff,' and I suppose it is, in that it's pictures with a lot of buildings. It doesn't really bear a lot of resemblance to real architectural photography, though. It's more urban lanscape-y and an attempt to see where we are right now. 

I keep asking myself that question at odd moments, almost like a koan: "Where am I?" Usually trying to figure out where I am in whatever thing I'm doing at that particular moment, but also this implied "Where am I going?" that's really more interesting.
