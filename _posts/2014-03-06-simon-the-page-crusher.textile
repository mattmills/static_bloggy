For some reason, I don't have any of evryone else who was there that night in the edit. Probably because Merchnats is a dark hole of a bar, a place you're likely to find trouble if you go looking for it. Since I don't tend to do that, it was a pretty friendly neighborhood bar. Of course, now that I'm in a different neighborhood, I'll have to find my pints of friendliness elsewhere. It was the darkness, anyway, that caused the trouble; hard to focus, and hard to get non-blurry shots. Anyway, a real post with more than one photo coming soon.
