<p>So, I&#8217;ve been having some issues with the site, mostly due to my own idiocy, but I think they&#8217;re resolved and anything that happens from now on will be filed under &#8216;new issues&#8217;. Note: When configuring nginx, just tell it to listen on port 80, leave off the &#8216;default&#8217; that most configurations seem to have. If you need ssl too, that&#8217;s port 443. There.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some pictures. I&#8217;ve been down with some kind of chest cold/flu, but I&#8217;m coming back slowly. Coughing and hacking all the way, and a sinus infection to boot, but I&#8217;m not all run down the way I was there for a while. I think I must&#8217;ve picked it up at the fair.</p>
<p>This is a weird admonishment. I don&#8217;t know why, exactly, but telling people to take comfort in rituals, when that&#8217;s most of what people do already, well, it freaked me out a little. It&#8217;s like saying &#8216;Be complacent, be normal&#8217;. Odd.</p>
