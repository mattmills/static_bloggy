So, just after we got back to the US, I got on another plane to go to Denver for RubyConf. It was actually a really good conf, where I learned some interesting stuff (as opposed to the confs I've been at, where I did the hallway track the whole time). Denver herself is a beautiful city, great sunrises, good walking, if a little cold after the Mediterranean.
