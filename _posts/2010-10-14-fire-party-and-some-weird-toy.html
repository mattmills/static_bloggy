<p>Well, I promised fun and adventure and pretty ladies, and the last two or three weeks have been full of that. Also full of chest cold sickness, but I&#8217;m 90-95% better now. I haven&#8217;t been this sick from a cold in years and years. The only thing keeping me together has been orange juice and cold pills. The cold pills don&#8217;t exactly seem to work, but they&#8217;re not hurting that I can tell. Anyway, this party was before I got sick.</p>
