<p>While everyone else is nappin&#8217; away the afternoon figured I do one of these.</p>
<p>friends<br />
naps (when I get &#8217;em)<br />
my computer<br />
cameras (in general and mine specifically)<br />
beer<br />
bikes<br />
brunch<br />
dinner<br />
pizza<br />
having a good job<br />
friends (gotta say it twice)<br />
cooking<br />
music<br />
dogs<br />
cats<br />
hot showers in the morning<br />
my bed</p>
<p>etc. etc. I could keep doing this for a while. Anyway, happy turkey day, and for tomorrow, happy buy nothing day.</p>
