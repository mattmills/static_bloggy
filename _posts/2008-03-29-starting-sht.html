Yep, the last week has been a doozy. Let's see... I started out with a hangover and cold. I decided to build a camera, and to get everyone else in the world to help me. www.opensourcecamera.org. I also finally got around to starting that magazine, called Gestalt, www.gestaltnews.com. I took some photos, wandered around a bit. Talked to Lora some, maybe straightened out some things with her. Haven't talked to Jess, though, hopefully she'll get back to me soon. I had a nice day driving around today, anyway. I'm gonna let the pictures tell the rest.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-1.jpg"><img style="" 0px="" auto="" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Elaine's new installation...<br><br><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>At the bar<br><br><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>I don't think he likes me.
