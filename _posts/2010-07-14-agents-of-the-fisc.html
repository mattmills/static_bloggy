<p>&quot;<br />
The piers are pummelled by the waves;<br />
In a lonely field the rain<br />
Lashes an abandoned train;<br />
Outlaws fill the mountain caves.</p>
<p>Fantastic grow the evening gowns;<br />
Agents of the Fisc pursue<br />
Absconding tax-defaulters through<br />
The sewers of provincial towns.</p>
<p>Private rites of magic send<br />
The temple prostitutes to sleep;<br />
All the literati keep<br />
An imaginary friend.</p>
<p>Cerebrotonic Cato may<br />
Extol the Ancient Disciplines,<br />
But the muscle-bound Marines<br />
Mutiny for food and pay.</p>
<p>Caesarâ€™s double-bed is warm<br />
As an unimportant clerk<br />
Writes I DO <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">LIKE</span> MY <span class="caps">WORK</span><br />
On a pink official form.</p>
<p>Unendowed with wealth or pity,<br />
Little birds with scarlet legs,<br />
Sitting on their speckled eggs,<br />
Eye each flu-infected city.</p>
<p>Altogether elsewhere, vast<br />
Herds of reindeer move across<br />
Miles and miles of golden moss,<br />
Silently and very fast.</p>
<p>&quot;<br />
