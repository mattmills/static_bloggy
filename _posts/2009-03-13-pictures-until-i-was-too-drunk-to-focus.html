title: Pictures until I was too drunk to focus

By which I actually mean there are more photos, and some of them are in focus, but after the last one here (which we'll pretend was intentional), I was walking the fine line between blackout and just stupid, and so none of those photos are any good. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I'm actually not sure any of these are any good, but they're kind of fun, at least. That's the threshold these days for blog-worthy photos, if I think someone I know will get a laugh or like it or link or somesuch, then I'll put it up. Actually, there's a quality threshold as well, see paragraph 1 for example. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Wednesday was a pretty epic night, and actually it's a good thing, because my money's just about run out again. Time to find another jobby job. I did a pretty good job of embarrassing myself in front of girls I barely know, and some old friends in the mix too. It's strange, the way things run in circles sometimes. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I've never seen a look on Cyrus's face like the one below, but it's probably always there under the surface- a sort of laughing incredulity. Either that or it's drunkface and I'm reading too much into a picture.  <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Reagan always makes the best photo-faces. It's like she's screaming "I"M REAGAN" with her whole face. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />And here's the old friends I was talking about- Chase and Brian- I've known Brian since high school. He'll probably get pissed and send me more death threats, but that's a risk I'm willing to take to bring everyone quality photos. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I really like this pic, for some ineffable reason. I know, I know. Shoot me. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos"/>
