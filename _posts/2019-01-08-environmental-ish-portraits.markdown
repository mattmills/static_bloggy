I think this might've been the night of Allie's birthday, but according to this edit (and my somewhat blurry memory) I failed to get a decent picture of the birthday girl. I did take all these pictures that I like and am tempted to crop. But, when I do that, they don't seem to work as well any more. The environment around them adds character. Actually the one of Sophie I'm not tempted to crop, but the other two, I am. But I tried that, and they don't work.  

Today, I got to shoot photos with a bunch of cool folks; the [Bay Area Film Photography Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Film-Photography-Meetup/). Worth checking out if you're in the Bay area and are willing to shoot film for a little while. I still enjoy it, anyway.
