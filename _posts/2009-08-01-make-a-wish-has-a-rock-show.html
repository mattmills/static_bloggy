Sometime Last week I found out that some of my friends from highschool were doing a benefit show for Make-a-Wish Foundation, and they needed a photographer. So, I ent and shot a few things, didn't stay the whole night. The first band was really shitty, the same three chords, all at the same tempo, and the same one note drone from the lead singer for every song. It was boring and shitty. then Hundresomethings came on, and well, they were better. They still lack a little edge, I don't know what they need, but it's not bad to hear live. Then I had to go. The good news: they raised over $2k last night. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/makeawish/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/makeawish/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/makeawish/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/makeawish/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/makeawish/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/makeawish/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/makeawish/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
