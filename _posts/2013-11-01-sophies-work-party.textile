She says to me last night, "You know people like looking at pictures, right?"

So here are a bunch from her work party, and the drive home. The view from the Oakland hills is really rad. I didn't get many good pictures of the guests, the house, the spread, or anything you'd expect. If you can believe it, that was only the second cutest dog there. What can I say, I was tired.
