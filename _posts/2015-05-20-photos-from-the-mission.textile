The Mission is still my favorite neighborhood in SF. Noe Valley is where the hipsters have gone, but the mission still has some grit and dirt. Some non-white non-tech people, people not like me. Bars you could get stabbed in, cash only. Several of the world's best burrito joints. Yeah, what's not to like?.
