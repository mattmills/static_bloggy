<p>Here I am, trying to sleep, and I can&#8217;t. so I figure I&#8217;ll post something. These are from the shoot that sunday afternoon, with Kyle in Bartlesville. There were a lot of things that were wrong, unprepared-for, and generally hilarious about this shoot, but overall, I can&#8217;t complain, the images look pretty good. This is broken into two posts, just to ease the server load.</p>
