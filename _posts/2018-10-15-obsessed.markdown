I started this post two days ago, and then forgot about it. Been working on a million things at once trying to get ready for Japan in 10! Days! Everything I'm working on now is bonus material, not required for the main quest.

Anyway, if it seems like street shooting is taking the place of the other stuff I do, it's only because I'm obsessed with the Leica and I'm shooting everything every day. Just a ton of work, some of which is even good enough to show people. This is also trip preparation: practicing for taking pictures in Tokyo.

10! Days!
