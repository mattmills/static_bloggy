<p>sometimes you get lucky and the gods smile down on you when you walk out the front door and there&#8217;s a beautiful sunset with the weirdest light that makes the air feel thick, like you could cut it with a knife. And then you go on to a rad evening that ends in the weirdest way possible, babies and nazis and flat tires, oh my. Just sayin&#8217;:</p>
