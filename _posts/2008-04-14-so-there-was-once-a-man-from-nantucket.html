no, not really. No men have ever come out of Nantucket. /nonsense<br /><br />But seriously, it's been a good couple of days. I'm getting editors all on the same page, all but one of us has a section we're responsible for, and things are going well in general for gestalt. Gestalt is the magazine I'm starting that anyone can write for. <br /><br />Let's see, where did we leave off? Last Friday, I think it was. So, on friday, I woke up sore, sometime around three in the afternoon. did some vague things around the house, found the photos I've been promising Sabrina for forever, went over to Frankie's  house to give them to her and hang out. Hung out there for a while, drank some beers. Talked a little about religion, and little innocent me, I just sat there with my mouth shut while dude was talking about his male christian conception of god, and how that was natural and innate in all of us. Sometimes it's better to just shut your mouth, and this was one of those times, because besides that little hitch, dude was pretty cool. <br /><br />Let's see, other than that... had a boring saturday. Finally went to bed at around 4am, got up at 8:30. Blueberry muffins for breakfast, then we went to sams, where we bought a bed for my dad finally. Which means I have my room back. <br /><br />Lets say that again: I HAVE MY ROOM BACK! YAY! Hey, if I can't shout from my stupid blog, where can I shout from?<br /><br />So yeah, got most of my stuff into the room, organized a little, then I had to do yard work for a while. Mow grass and clear sticks and such. My knees are killing me today, but the rest of me is all right. <br /><br />After that, 'cause we haven't seen each other in a few days, I went out to get coffee with Lora and hang out for a bit. She was in a weird mood, really distant. I was no help, because I was really happy about the room and talking to Jess earlier. I have a feeling what's wrong for Lora, but if I say it out loud it won't be true, even if it is. I was really tired while we were walking, from the yard work, and pulled out my phone to check it. I had to stare at it for a minute to make sense of what it was saying. Then I put it away, and Lora said something, I forget what, and I explained that I just couldn't make sense of the phone, had to stare at it for a second, but it still wouldn't resolve into something that I understood. And she said, yeah, I'm having one of those moments with my life right now. So yeah, I hope she's all right. <br /><br />And after that, all I did was come home and drink bourbon. Despite my usual bad luck with that particular liquor, I was fine, finally went to bed at a reasonable time after almot two weeks of being fully nocturnal. Of course, then I woke up at 4:30 am. Now, pictures.
