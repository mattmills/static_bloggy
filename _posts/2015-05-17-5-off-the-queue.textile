Yes, I'm alive. The blog is not yet dead, even though I see many other bloggers hanging up their keyboards. I could use a different, slicker, easier platform. I could just stick all my photos up on flicker. But then where would I ramble on aimlessly?

Anyway, here are the first five photos out of my quick collection. They're not related, except they were shot in this order, within a couple days of each other.
