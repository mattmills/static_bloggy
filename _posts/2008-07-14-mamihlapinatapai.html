I've experienced the situation that word describes so many times it's excruciating. Not this weekend though. No future exes found, just a lot of Santa Fe love. It's a mad cool town. I'm stuck in a rut, and then I go there and I start to do stuff again. Looking for a model to play around in front of a white backdrop. We'll see. Pictures!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Alex on a trike. Why not?<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Tourists.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>In the woods.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>At the tin star, I think this guy was some kind of big deal. Even if he wasn't he sure could play.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>And this little kid was too awesome . me and Alex decided he was a combination of the two of us- loves to take stuff apart (me) and totally narcissistic (Al), loving attention. He's a monster and he's going to take over the world.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-7.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Finally, here's Alex's fingers. From the bus hitting him, his right pinky is not right.<br /><br />And I just cut a picture of a sunset arbitrarily, and I'm declaring no more sun/cloud pictures for a while. Shit gets old, even if they are pretty.
