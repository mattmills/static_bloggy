<p>And by pre-gaming, I mean I went to a show, to warm me up for all the other shows. I could have used a drink, as this was a TV taping and all those cameras made me kinda nervous, but after a couple takes I got used to them and was able just to enjoy the music. 
<br/><br/>
Why I was there exactly is a little complicated- a friend is a PA or something for the show, and I ran into her when I was in Stillwater a couple months ago at a show, and she asked me to do some stills for them, so I did. And I guess as a thank-you and because they needed warm bodies in the seats, I got to go to the on set taping of the show, Warehouse something or other.

I&#8217;m kinda in love with what that lens can do. It&#8217;s hard to focus and hard to use, but the stuff it does is unique.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/coupleweeks/0009.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/></p>
