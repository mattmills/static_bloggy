I mean, this was a really nice night. Sophia's mom took us out to dinner. We had really nice sushi in downtown Oakland. our uber driver on the way was this old chinese lady, very nice, but strange. so i took pictures out the window. There are wonders everwhere. 

can I say how much I love this woman, my wife? no, no I cannot.  

for some reason, this stupid keyboard is hating on my setup again; all the capital letters aren't working. (update: seems like an iSSH bug).
