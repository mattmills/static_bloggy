fuck it. I was going to write something but instead I cut it because let's face it, even I don't want to listen to my bullshit long enough to write it. The photos, though, I could stare at for hours... not that I do, you think I have time for that? no, I'm to busy doing your mothers. All of them, alphabetically. I'm all the way to 'c' now.
