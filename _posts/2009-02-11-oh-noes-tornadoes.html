Funny story: for the pictures of everybody crouded together in the bathroom, that was for the second cell that passed over us, the one that wasn't really anything to worry about.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />My first day in the office was actually good. Doing sysadin-like duties already, although I don't really think I qualify for the title yet. Or at least I was doing them until the power went out. Point for twitter- I found out about the storm a little ahead of everyone else on twitter. Then I sat there for twenty minutes trying to find decent radar coverage (not really possible on the internet, unless you get a live feed from the tv stations, which is easier to get from, say, a TV).<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" />
