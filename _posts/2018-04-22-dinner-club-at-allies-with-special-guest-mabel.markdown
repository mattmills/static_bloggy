I think this was february? (checks date in photo metadata, without which I would only know it was "sometime in the past") yep for sure february. the 19th. There was lasagna and a dog and stories. I may be being slightly silly. 

These are black and white because they don't work in color. mixed LED and CFL bulbs is my suspicion. I don't go in for the whole color masking acts of god thing that some people do. As the saying goes, Ain't nobody got time for that.
