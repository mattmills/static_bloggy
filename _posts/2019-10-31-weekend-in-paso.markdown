This might've been the weekend after the trip to Yosemite? We've been running all over the last couple months, but I think it's going to settle down til Christmas, at least.

I still need to get out and shoot some. Driving down the street yesterday I say, it's all right here, I think it'll just fall into place now that I have a clearer idea of what the hell I'm after. Probably 6 months of chasing the light, if I'm lucky. Now that I've said that I've cursed myself to another decade of working on it. Ah well. More as it gets done.
