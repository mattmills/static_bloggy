<p>Went to this three(four?) weeks ago, and it was actually a pretty good time. The talks were a little on the basic side, I think because a lot of the heavy hitters in the <span class="caps">OKC</span> tech scene were absent (I&#8217;m looking at you, Grant). I gave three talks, and in one, it turned out my audience knew more about the subject than I did, so I got to learn some things.</p>
