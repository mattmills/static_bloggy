Three weeks ago, it was Sophia's birthday, and we had the dinner on the night of at AsiaSF, a drag show venue in SOMA. It was a hell of a show, but my camera's autofocus wasn't quite up to the light in there. Got some nice photos of most of our party, excepting Jason. The second picture is Sophie taking her birthday shot from one of the performers. The last one is the only decent shot of the performance I got; there were 4 (5?) ladies, and they all did a couple numbers between courses. A super fun evening.
