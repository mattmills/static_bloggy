I like beer. I like women, I like sunlight on my face. I like the cold of the morning, the warmth of laying next to someone. I like wandering, meeting new people, the light of streetlights, the light when there isn't any. <br /><br />I like my bicycle, the wind in my face. I like sweating and feeling tired and the deep ache of exhaustion. I like sleep, I like to dream. I like taking pictures. I like my job, because I like money. <br /><br />I like the feeling of moving. I like getting on a plane. I like just driving for the sake of moving, without a destination. I like the music of the road, both from the stereo and the tires. <br /><br />I like the curve of your hips, your deep brown eyes, your quick smile, the way I can read you so easily. I like the way you smell, even in the morning. I like your tattoos.  I miss you, Jess.<br /><br />That's all, except to say that you could easily put love instead of like.
