nobody could believe what was happening... I could scarcely deal with it myself... I mean, look at these girls... and I wasn't on my game, just imagine what was actually happening... <br /><br />seriously though, I need to do some catch up on photos... these are seriously stale... expect a post every three hours until I'm caught up to what's in the camera right now. no promises that the front text will make any more sense than this one did. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0021.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0022.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
