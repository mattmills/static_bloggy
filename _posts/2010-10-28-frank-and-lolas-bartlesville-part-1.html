<p>Went to Bartlesville a couple weeks ago, saw the sights, did some things, got into stuff. My friends Heather and Kyle invited me up to see a show, Truckstop Honeymoon, and to shoot Kyle&#8217;s two-man band, er&#8230; not sure what their name is, I&#8217;ll update this when I find out.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are from the frist part of the night I spent there, the time in the bar, the band (truckstop h), this rad little girl who couldn&#8217;t stop hula-hooping, and Kyle and Heather are the sickeningly sweet couple in the last shot. The sweetly engaged-later-that-night couple. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re officially announced to the world, but hey, now they are. Of course, I can&#8217;t think of anyone who reads this who they wouldn&#8217;t want knowing. (As a blogger, I still haven&#8217;t gotten it through my head that people I don&#8217;t know actually read this shit).</p>
