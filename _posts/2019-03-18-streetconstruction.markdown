I need to shoot more portraits. I know I've said that before, but dang. All this street stuff and the not-street kinda landscape-y stuff has dulled my portrait sense. For a while there, it was like a superpower. Gotten soft, I suppose.

Anyway, I put these together for a blog post the other night and then the internet went out and since it was 1:30 already I just went and passed out. Here they are.
