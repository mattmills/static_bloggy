and not talk about the fact that I did a post like the previous one (braggadocio) then abandoned my blawg for... a month. Nevermind the part where I MOVED ACROSS THE COUNTRY and HAD MANY ADVENTURES and what not, including a two week period where my hard drive was completely inaccessible. Oh well. This is where the catching up starts. I also, of course, haven't done anything on any weightier projects either. There's only been time for work and survival (eat, sleep, pack, unpack). Hopefully this weekend will be restful as well.
