These are the last photos from my trip to SF. Went to a lovely barbecue with the devs, and then walked to the nearest BART station, which was a bit of a hike with my luggage, but the fact that I'd had plenty of beer with the food helped, and I made it just fine, with plenty of time to get to my gate. A good trip.
