description: "Something clever here"
---

This was another walk, the one that separated ICP from the Whitney, which I got to with about an hour and a half before they closed. I didn't take many pictures inside, pictures of museums all look the same to me. The street, though, the street is always moving, always changing. In New York, there wasn't just a feeling of newness, but this feeling of many layers of history built up over time. That feeling of deeper history was one of the things I really liked. Another thing I liked: not everybody works in tech. Like, apart from the conference I was at, I didn't meet a single engineer the whole time. Legit.

Yeah these are just street photos. Yeah a lot of them are shot from the hip. I've decided I'm OK with that. There's just no time to stop and ask on the street. Sometimes I'm also shooting as I bring the camera up to my eye. Sometimes, it's things that would be gone in the time it takes to bring the camera to your eye. There's [this great video](https://vimeo.com/116692462), where Jay Maisel espouses the opposite approach, which I've been trying lately with some success. That is: walk slower. No, Stop. Wait. Something will happen. Take the picture that happens in front of the camera, not the one you're looking for. We'll see where it takes us.
