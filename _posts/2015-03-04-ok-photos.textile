These are somewhat out of order, but I wanted the two verticals together. I was in Oklahoma for 13 days in December, then we came back here to have a chill xmas an new year. It was good to see everyone, including the folks I didn't get photos of. Sorry! I was really frustrated with the old camera at this point, and had just about given up.

With this post, we're now approaching this year! SO. FAR. BEHIND.
