There's a component to my photography that's all about just trying to see what's in front of me, the beautiful, the strange, whatever. People us fishing or hunting analogies; but really it's a physical sport, looking for and catching these things. Can you see the line in time to get your camera to your eye? Is your muscle memory tuned to remember where the buttons are, the knobs turned right as you're getting ready to shoot?

Lately, and I'm not sure why, but all the accrued skill that I have seems to have taken leave, and I haven't made any really signifigant photographs in months. It's possible that my concentration is just elsewhere, focused on the watch project, and my other skills are deteriorating. I don't think it works that way, but maybe it does. Spend to much time in an analytical mindset, and the 'relaxed concentration', the zen modes, seem to go away. Maybe I just need to get out and shoot some more. Ferry tomorrow, we'll see if that helps.
