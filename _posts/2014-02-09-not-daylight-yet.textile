It occured to me, looking at these photos, that it'll be light again soon when I get to the beach on these rides. We're currently as far from the solstice as we were in late october, which makes me kinda happy, although it's dark now, at 6pm. SOON. 

The last couple rides out there I haven't really taken any photos, because it's started to feel like I'm repeating myself. So the light coming back will be a welcome change. I _do_ think that there is a photo of a bunch of dudes around a bonfire somewhere in the queue.
