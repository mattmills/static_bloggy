This was getting to one of the many things that happen around 16th and mission; I have no idea what I was doing there, and I'm too tired to go look it up. I just finished sorting through the roughly 12000 photos I took in 2017, looking for more San Pablo work. I found quite a bit, and realized in the sorting that 2017 was a hell of a year. A whole crapton of things happened.

Anyway, as I said, I'm pretty tired, but here's some photos for today. hopefully I'll get some more up tomorrow or later in the week.
