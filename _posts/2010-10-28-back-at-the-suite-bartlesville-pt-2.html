<p>So, when I went up there, I thought I was going to be sleeping on a couch. This is fine, I&#8217;ve done it many times before, and don&#8217;t really mind. Kyle had other ideas. He got me a suite in the Price Tower, which if you don&#8217;t know, is the only skyscraper designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (well, the only one that got built, at least). I don&#8217;t know how, I only know that he paid very little for it through some connection he had. Nice if you can get it, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>Anyway: the photos. I forgot to mention in that first post that KJ came up with me, to keep me company on the drive and to see all her B-ville friends that she hadn&#8217;t seen in six months. Everybody came and partied in the suite for a minute, and then around four a.m. I kicked &#8217;em out and went to sleep. Took some architecture shots in the morning, because it was a pretty cool room. Two story, 1.5 bath, kitchenette. Great angles and lines. Yeah, and then I got ambushed with a photoshoot. But first! Brunch!</p>
