Last saturday was a very long, very good day... it had phases, I did things. I walked the dog with Damaris, then hung out with her and Grant and some other kids for sdinner and drunken fry, and then down to makers and bricktown for fog and fun. Makers is where god would hang out, if he was looking for a jazz club in this town. And the Fog... yeah, it gets a capitol letter. Good stuff. The fog outside lifted the fog inside, if you will. And if you won't, well, too bad. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
