Went out last night. Did the whole blue note/ladies night thing. Tommy G came and picked me up, and off we went, into the night. It was nice to see some of the people out that I hadn't seen in two weeks. Of course, as sure as the night before, the morning after is a bitch. I woke up and I couldn't move, there was a lot of pain. I'm sure it was a combination of attempting to detox and the night out, but still, I'm glad the pain pills were within arms reach. <br /><br />So, as things stand, I still need to get a lawyer, I don't know if there's going to be long term damage, and I still don't have a job. Sometimes I need the pain pills and sometimes I don't. it seems to depend on what I've been doing more than anything; the easier I take it, the better off I am. <br /><br />On the good news list, I have a camera now, thanks to Ken's boss. It's a digi Rebel, nothing to write home about, but it's functional, at least, and I figure I could do worse. It's not like I have any assignments anyway. Project idea: Photograph all the stuff people have loaned/given me while convalescing. I might work on that after my nap. photos of last night to follow later too.
