This was what, sometime in April? Vlad is a friend from the internet, I think, and he's definitely 'from the internet'. His birthday party was app themed. My app was "in development" because I'm terrible at costumes. My wife, the genius, went as a polaroid app, and took pictures and printed them on demand. There was an instagram, a draw something, an ATM app, a recipe app... you get the picture.
