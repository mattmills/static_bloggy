So, after the robots, we came out and it was nighttime, and I don't _really_ remember what happened. I think we probably walked somewhere and got some food and went back to the hotel. The pictures seem to indicate we walked through Shinjuku some more, getting closer and closer to the hotel.

I feel like right now there are a bunch of things I'm supposed to be working on, and if I can pull off half of them, I'll be doing pretty good. The short list in no particular order:

* building a headlamp (mostly done; board bringup and programming left)
* building a bike frame (maybe 1/3rd of the way done)
* live art installation at Priceless festival (woot! this should be simple and fun)
* Parents' visit (Hi Mom!)
* making bags (this should be higher in the list)
* brewing beer (which is really hosting dinner for people while someone else brews beer)
* zine shelf (for a friend)
* all the _other_ photography I'll probably do.

Oh, also hold down my day job because only one of the things on this list pays in money. I'm not mad about it, per se, just that I've set myself some lofty goals for shit to get done this summer. At least now I've put the short form of the list somewhere more concrete than twitter.
