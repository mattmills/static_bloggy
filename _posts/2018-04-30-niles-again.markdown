Last day of april, down to the last hour and half. I didn't make a post a day, but I made one almost every weekday, and that's something. 

These photos are from May, when we went down to Niles to hang out with John and Grant and Damaris. There are a couple film scans from that same day I'm still working on, to be posted later (and I need to get the color film developed, still).

So here's today.
