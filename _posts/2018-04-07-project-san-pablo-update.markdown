Still working on this, despite the radio silence and despite the lack of coherent narrative. There's something about it that won't let me go. I just keep shooting, hoping to find something. A lot of times, I'll work this way for months and months (I think this project is nearing the year mark). 

It just occured to me, looking at these photos, that I could do a series just on the liquor stores on this street, and have something interesting. Hmm. 

I know, the Albany Cinema isn't _on_ San Pablo, but the picture was taken from SP, so I'm calling it canon. For now.
