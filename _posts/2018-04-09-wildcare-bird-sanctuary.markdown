description: "some pictures for yr eyes"

This was a super brief visit to [WildCare](https://www.discoverwildcare.org/), where things were pretty chill at the end of a Saturday. Looking at the Pelican, and having spent no small amount of my younger years staring at dinosaur skeletons, drawings, simulations, and the movie Jurrassic Park, I don't know how anyone can not see that these are 100% dinosaurs. They don't move like reptiles. They're not even shaped like reptiles. 

The photos of the bird were taken through the cages; none of them save the last one was in the open. The trick to getting photos that aren't completely blocked up with fence is to get as close as you can to the wires, open your lens all the way up, and find a hole. Pay attention to the viewfinder, and move around until the picture looks the most clear. It should go without saying, but here I am saying it anyway: don't do this in the case that it might put you in danger. As Clayton Cubitt said on twitter:

> Famed war photography Robert Capa once said &quot;If your pictures aren&#39;t good enough, you&#39;re not close enough&quot; but he also died at 40 when he stepped on a land mine, so &quot;closeness&quot; is not always what it's cracked up to be.

I've gotta say, though: Capa was making important pictures; he knew that; he also knew the stakes. _Vitam impendere vero._
