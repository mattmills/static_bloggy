I deleted over 1000 lines of code today. That was the easy part.  I worked on the watch on lunch; board rev 2.2 is at the fabricator. I fixed some things at work, made some other things work better, then I came home. I shopped, I cooked, I cleaned (although not as much as my lovely wife). I used a trick I learned from a cartoon to make my sauce less salty. Archer, thanks. Now it's time to sleep.
