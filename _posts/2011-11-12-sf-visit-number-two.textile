title: Then I got on a plane

So I woke up at the ungodly hour of 5am after all that madness and grabbed all my stuff and walked over to the gf's (who wasn't yet anything other than an interesting friend) house, and woke her up, and she drove me to the airport. I like morning flights, you never end up done with everything and having hours to kill before them. It's always wake up and go. 

Anyway, I get through security and put my shoes back on and have just enough time to get a burrito before I get on what might be only the second or third direct flight of my life; really quite nice to get on one plane and get off at your destination after a nice litle nap. Anyway, I disembarked, got on the bart and headed to my hotel; even napping on the plane I was still exhausted, so I took another nap. 

Then we went out to Seemant's house boat, docked in Oakland, and had steaks and chips and a ton of beer. People talked, I got reasonably inebriated, and then we all tried to take the ferry, but it was closed early for fleet week. So, we all got back on the BART and went back to our respective hotels.

Then I did something that seemed like a good idea at the time: I opened the window. Long story short, I was sick for two days with what I thought was a bad head cold, but turned out to be bad allergies. A day of cold medicine and a day of sudafed and then finally claritin did me right and reduced my symptoms to a headache. Which is why, in case any of the people who were there are wondering, I looked and felt slightly off all week.

Other than that, it was a week of meetings and eating spectacular food and a lot of walking. LOT of walking.
