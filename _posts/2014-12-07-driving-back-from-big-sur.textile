The California coast is one of the most amazing places. I'm glad I was there, for at least a bit. I said to someone on twitter today (@monicabyrne13:"https://twitter.com/monicabyrne13", who's book:"http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Road-Monica-Byrne-ebook/dp/B00GVZZL7A/" you should read, and who  is awesome) that I'm almost always jealous of people that are somewhere else, as long as somewhere else isn't somewhere I've been long enough to be disenchanted by. It's really hard to hold still, with so much wonder in the world.

Larry Ellison, of Oracle, has a house somewhere on this coast, probably one of the most expensive houses in the world. I'm not interested in a house on these hills. I'm happy to move through them, and see them, and move on. I've got a lot going on here in the next year or so, but after that, I may have to hit the road again. There is too much to see.
