Just two random photos from the queue. Woke up with a sober hangover this morning. It's like waking up after a night of heavy drinking, but without the fun of the night before. A full night's sleep, where you wake up still tired and wondering just what the hell happened to you. Luckily, this morning, somebody brought me coffee. If you know me, you know how much it means to me to be woken up with a cup of coffee. Yay life. 

Anyway, the photos: Traci and Sky after a ride (come to think of it, this was the last time we rode) and then, a sunset storm.
