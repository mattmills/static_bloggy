Let's see... this was two weeks ago? I was out in SF again to get trained in what we call the 'fireman' role. Basically, a fire is a problem caused by the platform, requiring both access to the backend and knowledge of our code base to solve. So I got a week long crash course in all that. It's a big app that does a lot between a lot of services, so it was more figuring out how to find out what I'd need to know than rote memorization. 

Also, of course, there was the non-work times. A week in one of the most beautiful cities in the world? Yes. Any time. On my last two days, I flirted with the idea of staying for another week, but I knew that that would just turn into me extending the stay as long as possible (two weeks, then a month, then finding an apartment...). Not a problem for anyone out there, but a bitch for some people back here. Plus, I would have missed mothers' day brunch, and I couldn't have done that.
