Barbecues in Cali don't tend to revolve around the grill in the way that they do in the midwest. This one was really about playing music (if you could) and trying all of Jacob's beers. A very nice afternoon, in really good light. As the sun got lower, veiling flare became a real problem, but I don't have a lens hood. Oh well; I think I did OK, anyway.

Thanks to Jacob and JBird for hosting.
