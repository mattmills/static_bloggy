I ran/walked in this... as you can see from the photo, I found out just how out of shape I am. Of course it was hella hot and they didn't have much water for us, for some reason. Normally I'd say, "Walk two miles? No problemo," but this was actually hard. I mean, nothing a shower and a quesadilla couldn't fix, but yeah. Isn't Sophie lovely, even all covered in dye?
