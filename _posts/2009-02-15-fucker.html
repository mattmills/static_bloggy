So yesterday was a fucker of a day. After I said all that about loving life on the road and how I'd rather be doing my job than carousing and womanizing and drinking (still basically true), I had a fucker of an afternoon. <br /><br />It was made worse by the fact that I had a great morning- I was shooting really well, not too tired or too sore in the shoulders. Well, there was a bit of technical difficulty at the beginning (I had changed my manual ip to try to get my comp working on their network, and voila, it worked, but then the guys out front couldn't connect to me. Never mind they could've found me in the network browser). But being a little pissed just sharpened me up, and I hit all the marks just right. That I also have to make up the marks as I go, or rather intuit them (an important philosophical difference, but we have to many parentheticals already) makes no difference.<br />  <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fromtheroad/leonardsign.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Then the afternoon came. Groups of dancers, first duo/trios, and then gradually increasing until there were 30 on the floor. So, just as we were getting into the groups of 6-8, one of the pins bent in on my card reader and I was in trouble. So, I sent the guys out front, my boss, an IM asking for help. I get no response, and in short order I had worked through my extra cards. So, I ran out to their area, and in the process, missed a dance routine. Threw me off the rest of the afternoon. Got heated there for a second and I was tempeted to walk off from the whole thing, but my better nature prevailed, and I'm still employed. that is, they didn't fire me for a mistake, and I didn't walk off mad. <br /><br />Then dinner, and my boss was in hot water for us leaving "early." Early being maybe 15 minutes to beat the crowd. Oh well, now nobody in the  whole crew gives a shit, we're only doing this job for the money anyway. Why won't people figure out that giving subordinates shit just pisses them off and gets you less work, of lower quality? Foster a good work environment, and good things happen. Positive reinforcement. When your buisiness depends on creative people, all that bad emotion can really fuck up their day, which in turn screws your product. <br /><br />Enough rambling, back to work for me.
