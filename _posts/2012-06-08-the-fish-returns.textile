So, for some reason I finally got off my lazy ass and rebuilt my fisheye. It's something I've been meaning to do ever since it broke on the way home from mexico last August (I never did get around to posting those pics). Anyway, suffice to say that super glue is not a strutural seal for anything that may take any kind of blunt force, like dropping, or time spent in my luggage. 

This is version 3 of this lens. The first two were prototypes, this one is a lot more usable. I used my dremel and made a focusing helical, even, so now the lens doesn't fall off the end of the camera. Proof is in the pudding. I'm aware that the fish is sort of a gimmick lens, but it's fun to play with.
