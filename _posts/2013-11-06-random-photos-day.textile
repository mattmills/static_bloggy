Today has been a very long day; started at 3am in SF and now I'm in OKC for 13 days, to help my mom with recovery from kidney transplant surgery. Anyone who's waited multiple years on a transplant list knows what a relief this is (that goes for families as well). No more dialysis is a big improvement in quality of life, to be sure, but having that whole chapter closed and being able to start a new one is a great thing. 

Anyway, travel and sleep interruptions left me a bit drained, so I thought it'd be a good time to share the collection of random images that has accumulated at the top of the queue. These are photos that didn't fit with whatever post I was doing at the time, but couldn't bear to part with. Nothing tying them together other than my presence.
