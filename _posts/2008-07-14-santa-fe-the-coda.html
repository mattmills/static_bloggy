so I went back to santa fe last weekend, saw some folks, did some santa fe things. I didn't go to whole foods. I did go into the mountains a couple times. Hit up the cowgirl, the tin star, and the catamount in a single night. stayed with alex, saw some other heads, missed Nicole somehow, I think she was herself just getting back from cali. <br /><br />It's not that okc is bad, it's that other places are so much better. Pictures to follow.
