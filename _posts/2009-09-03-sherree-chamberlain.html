This is the band and the singer/songwriter that the crew that I was there to photograph was there to film. Wait, let me rephrase. I showed up and my friend Tomee was there with a film crew to record Sherree and her band, and Tomee asked me if I would shoot some production stills, so I did. And I got backstage access for the whole show, and some nice pictures; My friend and fellow photographer <a href="http://jeremycharles.com">Jeremy Charles</a> said something on twitter about the joy of the performer being why he does concert photography, and I saw what he meant shooting these pictures. I shouldn't be surprised that he also has a <a href="http://www.jeremycharles.com/blog/index.php/2009/05/27/sherree-chamberlain-photos/">gallery</a> of photos of Chamberlain too. Dude knows what's up. Girl can sing and entertain and has the look too. <br /> <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
