Long weekend. Walking around festivals is exhausting. This was hardly simply, or hardly strictly, or something like that. A music festival that was a little bluegrass and a lot of other things: Gogol Bordello was playing, which was my main attraction. I remember being so exhausted at the end of this day that instead of going out to dinner with some friends, we cancelled on the way to dinner and went home to crash.

And the last photo is sort of a 'fuck you' to past me, that thought going all B&W would stop the sunsets.
