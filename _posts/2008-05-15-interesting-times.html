Despite the dark cloud of unemployment and impending insolvency, I've been remarkably up this weekend, mostly because I think I finally got out of the hole of a job I was in. The money was too good to give it up but not good enough to set aside what I thought of it, of the whole situation. I was a sell out, and I really hate that I did that even for a little while. Of course, I needed that period of transition to get out of the stupid funk I was in after coming back to oklahoma. A little distance for a little clarity, time to think without impending doom, etc.<br /><br />Silver linings, right? In disaster lies opportunity, phoenix has to burn first, etc, etc. I hope.<br /><br />I might have told you, but there are two versions of the story of hope in the greek mythos. This is before the great greek philosophers went and clogged western thought for the next few millennia. Anyway, they say Pandora opened her box and let out all the evils in the world. Curiosity, they say, and they're not the only ones to blame all the world's ills on curiosity or women (although I think the former gets us into more trouble). Well the two versions are different because of where hope comes from at the end. In one telling, it  is the last feeble curse to flap out of the box. In the other, the gods take pity on us poor dumb humans and give us hope, to make up for all the cruelty and misery and nonsense that they gave us. (A box that can never be opened? Totally a set up. Pandora is innocent!)<br /><br />Sometimes I believe the former, sometimes the latter. Sometimes hope is the only thing that keeps a fool like me going, and sometimes it is the only thing that leads me to do the things that I know are right and good. It has, a couple of times, caused me to fall on my face. I feel better having fallen than I would if I'd stayed at home, though. <br /><br />Pictures later, when I have something to post.
