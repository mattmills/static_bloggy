title: because I'm a sucker for a pretty lady

and because it's her birthday, and because, well, what are friends for? I'm posting yet another huge batch of photos to flickr. This time though, I'm going to be smart and only post highlights here and if you want to see the whole set you can head over there <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photomattmills/sets/72157617411519820/show/">by clicking this finely crafted link</a>.<br /><br />Sometimes I find that I know I have enough good pictures of something and yet I'm still shooting, something is knawing at me to keep going, and I don't really know why. On an "on" night, this means I come away with quite a lot of good stuff. This shoot was about 5% that I liked, and maybe as high as 20% that weren't crap, even by my standards. In a small party, that means a lot of pictures of the same people, and yet some people get missed, too. Sorry if I missed you. <br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
