What's this? Two posts in two days? It's as if I'm really blogging again. All I can say is, don't get used to it. I've got a bit of a backlog, but it won't last. I'm doing stuff again though, so that might bring up the post volume somewhat. 

These photos are from norman music fest. It was a good day; pretty much exactly what I needed at the time. Met up with Anne, hung out with some of her friends, ran into a bunch of mine, drank, got made fun of at the stand up set (all in good fun). For once, NMF wasn't an unqualified disaster. When I wasn't worried about rushing around to see any band in particular, and focused on the people I was hanging out with, it turned out to be a good time.
