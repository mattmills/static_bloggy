<p>So yeah, this was also a couple weeks ago. I think it was the sunday after christmas. Pretty sure, in fact. Jen made pumpkin pancakes, which were awesome. Other things happened, pictured below. Bobby skating. Porch sitting. Big B lookin like the big G with the sunlight coming from behind him. Canon on his lap though, and we all know canons are the devil&#8217;s camera. (this is another case of me either being funny or unintelligible. I don&#8217;t care which).</p>
