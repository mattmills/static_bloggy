OXFORD COMMAS. Now you know my stance on that subject. This was a night of bike riding and cards (and various plush things; the horse, the kid robot doughnut, etc). Maeghan and her dude seemed really happy, which is always a good thing. Yeah. that's all, except to say that game of thrones was EPIC tonight. 

Edit to add: appearently we played yahtzee and I won? I don't properly remember.
