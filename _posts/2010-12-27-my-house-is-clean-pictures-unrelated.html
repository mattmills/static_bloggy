<p>This is worth a blog post by itself&#8230; my house hasn&#8217;t been this clean since last spring at least&#8230; pretty sure I swept sometime last march&#8230; not really. But shit had gotten out of hand what with me having no time to clean and less energy than time. I scrubbed everywhere that needs to be scrubbed, swept what needed to be swept, and all my dishes are clean. funny story: my house stays cleaner when I&#8217;m broke. Although why I didn&#8217;t do this in the months between getting back from egypt and starting the new job I don&#8217;t know. anyway yeah, photos unrelated (from Athena and Aphrodite&#8217;s bday party):</p>
