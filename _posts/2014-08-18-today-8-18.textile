Today was a lot of gray, outside. Inside, I did a lot of work, catching up for being distracted by the news last week. I have a feeling it's only going to get worse for a while (weeks? months?), before it gets better. On the plus side, I made a ton of headway in a complex domain. I ran into a friend walking home from the BART, and we caught up andd talked about things for a few blocks. A turned-off TV asked me "RU OK?" and I am. Then we got to see some other friends, just home from Ireland. They brought me whiskey, which I'm now saving for a special occaision.
