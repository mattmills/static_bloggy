Today was a lot of gray, outside. Inside, I did a lot of work, catching up for being distracted by the news last week. I have a feeling it's only going to get worse for a while (weeks? months?), before it gets better. On the plus side, I made a ton of headway in a complex domain. I ran into a friend walking home from the BART.
