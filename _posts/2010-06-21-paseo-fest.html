<p>Not many pictures from this night made it through the edit filter. oh well. I have a tendency to try to make a narrative with photo series, but some nights just don&#8217;t fall into that pattern. Too much going on to get it all, or too much happening in bad light, etc. And sometimes my narrative making brain cells aren&#8217;t firing either. Of course, the gist of what happened is what you see in these photos, even if there isn&#8217;t a series of them. We drank. We chilled. That&#8217;s about it.
