More film work, this time Kelsey's birthday picnic. Lake Merritt > Dolores Park. Also, paper lanterns are magical. They're sort of difficult to light, but once they go, they float off into the distance, and disappear. 

Editing these photos was really difficult. I got way more attached to these than I usually would; maybe because I had to look at them longer (getting the distortion corrections as close as possible, curve corrections, dust spotting, etc).

Also, unrelated: I'm in Dublin! It's decent here. The smells and sights and sounds of another country.
