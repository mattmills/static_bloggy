More film work, this time Kelsey's birthday picnic. Lake Merritt > Dolores Park. Also, paper lanterns are really rad. Editing these was really hard for some reason. I got way more attached to these photos than I usually would; maybe because I had to look at them longer.

Also, unrelated: I'm in Dublin! It's decent here. The smells and sights and sounds of another country.
