<p>The number of things going on in this picture is at least double what you think it is. And then there&#8217;s all the things that happened that night that aren&#8217;t in the picture. A couple good rock bands, a hillbilly jug of sangria, a foamy (but free) keg, etc. etc. If I sat here and actually listed everything, you&#8217;d get bored and never read again. You had to be there. And you should have. <br/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/coupleweeks/0013.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/></p>
