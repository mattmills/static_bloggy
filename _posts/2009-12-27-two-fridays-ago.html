This was the night of Ali's birthday... sorry ali, didn't get any of you, as you were in tulsa... the following night I also didn't get any, because the light in the dfry is shit.  Also, I'm not shooting as much as I used to. it ebbs and flows, just like everything else, and right now, I'm at an ebb... I've just had an idea for a new project, though, one that's been staring me in the face for months and me not even noticing. The working title is 'hackers in the heartland'... a hacker in the sense of 'maker' or 'expert'. You know who you are, expect emails soon. Anyway, on with the photos. <br />  <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0038.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0039.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0040.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0042.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
