Whoever came up with this idea, it's amazing. For Gina's birthday, we all had to dress up as villans. I went as Dr. Evil, and Sophia did a mean poison ivy.  I'm obligated by our marrige vows to post the picture of her in the mask, I think. Also, for anyone who was wondering how to look at a camera, Jamie is showing you how in that 2nd to last photo.
