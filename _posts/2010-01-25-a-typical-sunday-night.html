As usual, these are a week delayed, so from 8 days ago. Sundays up at classics are pretty excellent though. More (and less blurry) pics from this last sunday coming soon, I promise. I just realized that none of these are in classics, which is just where we start, after all, not always where we finish. <br /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Boring club in Bricktown.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Exciting moment in the boring club in bricktown. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Random encounter outside the club.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
