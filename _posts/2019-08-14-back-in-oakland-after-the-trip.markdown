So these were from sometime after the trip. No idea why I was walking in this particular spot, or what I was doing that day. it's a little weird.

I'm missing some photos, actually; the last post was on the last day, but there were some more from that evening that I meant to post. We walked, we saw the Samurai museum, we walked some more. They're probably in a folder on my desktop machine. This is another experiment in mobile blogging, now from the iPad pro; the images were put together in LR mobile, and uploaded (somewhat painfully) over sftp. Hopefully this works.

Oh, also! I've started an email newsletter, at [tinyletter.com/photomattmills](https://tinyletter.com/photomattmills). I'm going to be putting more longform writing there, telling stories, recent photo one-offs, that sort of thing.
