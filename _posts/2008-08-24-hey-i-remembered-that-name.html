and other stuff, too. Arianna, and I have no idea why I got such a block about it. Actually, it could have to do with the emotional stress of the week and the madness therein. What else? I've been thinking about things to say on here and lots will occur when I'm out and about, but not a lot comes to me now. <br /><br />Definitely going to Egypt and Gaza in January. Actually, I'm only definitely going to Egypt, getting into Gaza is a matter of getting to know the right people once I'm on the ground, fining the right border guard to bribe, or a small row boat to row a few miles trough the blockade. Or any combination of the three above things. <br /><br />All of my backups are stale by a week now. If you don't know, this is a terrible thing. Although it's better than none at all, I need to run a full backup tonight. <br /><br />I bought new headphones today, both ears work, so that's good. Not much else to report. Money's low. more later if I get inspired of crazy or something.
