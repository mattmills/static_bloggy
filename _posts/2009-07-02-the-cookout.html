The chef from Cafe 7, which is on the northside somewhere (chime in in the comments if you know where it is). F'ing amazing ziti, pretty good kebabs, pesto crusted grilled chicken, it was nice. Some days I forget to eat until late in the day, and then circumstance prevents it for a couple more hours, and then I'm rewarded for the wait with a meal like that. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />It was really nice, but I wish I had more photos of the whole thing. Like I said, I was having an off day sunday, maybe because of the lack of sustenance. I had to let the hate pass before I could even look at the photos again, that's why I took these sunday and you're just now seeing them.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, I'm several days out from my last cup of coffee. I think that's what I'll go do now. That and get ready for TULSA: THE SEQUAL. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
