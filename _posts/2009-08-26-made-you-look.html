First off, a video: <br /><object width="640" height="358"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6277295&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6277295&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="358"></embed></object><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/6277295">B Boy Sequence II</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user932074">Matt Mills</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>.<br /><br />Then, just a few stills not in that sequence. The battle was decent, but I missed most of it, jumped up on stage with Chelsea (who you'll be hearing a lot more about in a little bit) and squeezed a spot with a view of the dance floor. Kicked some dudes bag out of the way. It was good to see the little part that I saw; the show was so small this year I wondered why they bothered. The art was all pretty decent, but nothing stuck with me. There should have been more, in more space. Bricktown wasn;t the place to have it, people. Anyway, photos: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Up next will be photos of the afterparty, which was way more epic.
