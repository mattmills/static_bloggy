I've decided I need to simplify a bit. I used to shoot in black in white all the time. There are myraid reasons: it's more graphic and striking, there's more process control, and it used to be cheaper. When that went away with digital, and I was able to shoot color at iso 3200, I went a little crazy with it. Now, there are plenty of reasons to shoot color. It's closer to reality (for a given value of reality). It can be more eye-catching. And there I'm out of reasons. 

I've been lusting after "this camera":http://www.amazon.com/Leica-10760-Monochrom-Compact-2-5-Inch/dp/B0082ES6HA for a while, but I realized, I have a perfectly good camera now, and the only thing that would get me is full frame. If I want to shoot black and white, I should just do it. So I am, starting now. This also solves the problem of a lot of the clich√©s I'm guilty of. Sunsets, especially. They're just not the same in black and white.
