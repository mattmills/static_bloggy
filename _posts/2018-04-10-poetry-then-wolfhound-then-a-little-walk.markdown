Didn't have much time at the reading; we got there a little late. I was inexplicably tired, and was thinking about bailing, but came at the last second anyway. I think Sophie might have encouraged me to come. This was Christine's thing, I think; at least, she was MC'ing. It was really quite fun, and I ended up liking more of the poets than I thought. 

I seem nice, but I'm a hater when it comes to art. Come correct or don't bother me.
