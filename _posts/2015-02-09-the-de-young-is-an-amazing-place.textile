Lots of photos in this one, because it's an awesome place, and the photos are nice. Also, I broke out photoshop on these, to get the skies in a couple of them burned in. It's been long enough since I used photoshop that all the tools are in slightly different places than I remember, but it's really snappy on this machine at least. I'm babbling.

Seriously, if you can, get to the de Young and have a walk around the sculpture garden, at least. The Turrell skyskape has to be experienced, as does seeing the building up close. There are a bunch of amazing sculptures, as well as a nice cafe. There's also a Japanese tea garden which is quite nice. A fine place to spend an afternoon walking around.
