Right now, I should tell the story of the excellent day I had shooting with <a href="http://www.jeremycharles.com/blog/">Jeremy Charles</a>, or rather him shooting and me assisting, but I think I can may be just say that it was a good time, picked up a few new tricks for my lighting bag, and it was nice to be able to talk to someone about photography who's been where I'm at and receive a little encouragement. Also, I had a moment to grab a few photos of the first band, who's name I forget. This is why I usually take notes of these things. Anyway, Photos (now with black borders!):<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/assisting/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/assisting/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/assisting/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/assisting/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
