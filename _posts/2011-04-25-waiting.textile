Right now, I'm at work, on lunch, just sort of waiting for it to be over. When I have lunch here in the office (microwaved something-or-other) it only takes ten minutes, as opposed to the hour or hour and a half going out somewhere usually takes. And it's cheaper, less than a buck for a sandwich and gatorade. And since there are only a couple decent restaurants in edmond anyway, I'm not missing much. The problem is, I've now got 50 minutes to kill. Luckily, I have a blog to write for...

The photo is about waiting, too. Leia here was waiting for a phone call, to go and pick her boyfriend up. It's complicated if you go deeper than that as far as details, but I like the photo anyway.
