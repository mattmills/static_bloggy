first one will be brief. This is from two wednesdays ago, for once I wasn't out at blue note, and Chelsea came down to get a cell phone (I have spares and hers was spastic). While I was looking for the charger, she says, "Why don't we go to norman and see my friends play a jazz set?" and of course I went. I always have some fantastic luck when I hang out with her; I met a former South African paratrooper at one party, or there was the time we came across fire-dancers just before a rock show, etc, etc. This time, one of the professors from OU showed up and asked to sit in, and dude was cool. Didn't hog the stage, played a couple good numbers, and left. And my five minutes were up a while ago: <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Trumpet playin' man.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><br />More later.
