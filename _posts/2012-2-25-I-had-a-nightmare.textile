title: I had a nightmare last night

The nightmare was my twitter got hacked. This is how good my life is right now, that's the worst my subconscious could come up with. Of course, I'm sure the world is going to come up with something much worse, now that I've said that. 

I haven't blogged for a while, but I'm not giving up. I thought about rebooting and redesigning and using another domain that already points here: <a href="http://photounrelated.com">photounrelated.com</a>. That may still happen. Of course, since all my traffic comes from twitter and facebook anyway, it doesn't matter, so long as the old links and the new ones still work.
