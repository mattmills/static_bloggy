So I mentioned in the previous post seeing my friend Alex, and I sorta can't believe I didn't take any pictures of him, but it was really amazing to see him. On the last night of our stay, we met in this Arthouse-cinema place; outside it was a cafe/bar, and inside they played art films. It was great to see him and catch up. He's in an Economics PhD program and kicking ass. 

Then there was the drive home. There were these amazing storms; one looke like the rain just stopped suddenly; we could see the clear air above the rain that was still falling. Then behind that storm, there was this weird dark mist (in the last photo). It was eaither really rapid evaporation in the heat that came behind the storm, or dust kicked up by the downdraft. But beautiful.
