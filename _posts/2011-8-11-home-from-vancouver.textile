So, vancouver was really beautiful. Coming home was difficult- not because I was sad to leave vancouver, but because of storms over denver. I was so tired. And yeah, I know I'm behind again. my resolution to keep up with the present in my blog lasted all of two posts. I'll be catching up today though, so keep an eye out. (also, the last pic is above denver, just so we're clear)
