<p>Taking photos of skaters is weird. I was doing it today, again, and really, it&#8217;s a completely different thing from photographing other kinds of athletes or doing regular portraits. It requires you to be very close to the action- you&#8217;ve got to be careful not to make yourself an obstacle while being in the middle of things, basically. Anyway, yeah. I&#8217;ve been off the last month. not shooting as well as I usually do. I&#8217;ll get it sorted. I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s just the winter blues, which usually go away as things warm up.</p>
