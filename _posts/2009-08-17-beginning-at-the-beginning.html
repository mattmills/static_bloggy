So I have a huge pile of photos from the last week, and I've been procrastinating on posting them because of work and lazyness and such, but here, finally, on a coffee fueled sunday night, I've gotten them all out and will post them in blog-sized chunks until I get bored with them and post all the rest in a large-ish post sometime on tuesday.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Mom on her first day as a retiree.

Also, he took the next photo, of Christa and me. Bewildered by focus as well. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Yeah, that's me. A sight rarely seen on the internets, although there are really far too many pics of me out there at this point.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Cmay in her natural habitat.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Lambo outside of work.
