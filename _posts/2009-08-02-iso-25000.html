So this is crazy, really wild, I mean, talk about no light, some of these are taken in the reflected mirror ball light off a black wall, just insanely no light at all, but here are the pictures. This is going to be fun. I'm playing around at ISO 25k, which is just unheard of, it's so noisy it's an extra level of abstraction. Focus is "guess and get lucky sometimes," other times it's just blurry and that doesn't really hurt things because these pictures aren't about detail but about energy and tone and exploring places that heretofore were invisible to the camera, and a lot of times to the eye. These are places people go but not places that are easily seen unless you go there, at least until now. Enough ramble.
