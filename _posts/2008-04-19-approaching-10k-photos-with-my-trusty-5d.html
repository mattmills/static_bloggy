title: "approaching 10k photos with my trusty 5d"

Which means, that along with the other 5D I had and shot over 7,000 pictures with, I've shot more photos with this camera than any I've ever owned, since last August. Lightroom has the number of photos I've taken since I got back from brazil at a staggering 14,000. That's 389 rolls of film, at $4/roll, plus 4 for dev costs... $3112 that I haven't spent on film. Of course, I've spent far more than that on cameras, but really, who's to say that I would've had better luck with film cameras? Anyway, this is all just idle speculation. Now, some pictures. This is the lens that inspired the title of the post about being an artist....<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog419-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog419-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />This woman was feeding the ducks.

A photo-project, an essay to commit myself to. More later, when I've had more time to think.
