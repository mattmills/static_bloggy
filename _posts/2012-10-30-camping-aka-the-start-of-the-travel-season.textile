I went camping with a bunch of cool folks at the end of September. This was simple car camping, not anything involving crazy hikes with a giant backpack or mountains (as if oklahoma had any). It rained on us all weekend, more or less; there was time to get the tens set up, and a little time for breakfast on saturday, and the rest of the weekend was spent under a tarp or inside our tents. Protip: tents are not sound proof. 

When I say the travel season, I mean the time when I personally find myself going all over the place for a period of about 6 weeks, biannually. This time, it was Camping, San Fransisco, Barcelona, and in tomorrow, I fly to Denver. As Tim told me, 'The game been good to me'.
