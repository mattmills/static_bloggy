I forgot my cf cards, and so I had to improvise and use my phone camera to take a few pictures. It was a very zen experience shooting this way, with complete simplicity. I was able to concentrate soley on the images.  you only have one button to push, and that's it. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/zenessay/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I was sitting there, at sauced, at Haley's booth, and I was watching all the ametures with their digital rebels, and I realized that the difference between them and the professionals I had worked around and with was principally one of concentration. The pros are zeroed in on what they are doing, the only thing in the world for them is the viewfinder. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Matty from the Rodchenko(sp?) angle. </span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/zenessay/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />On a completely different note, I found a really cool company called Elphel building the open source camera I dreamed up last year. they sell a bunch of boards that could theoretically turn any old 35mm film camera into a digital camera, in either black and white or color. Their examples kinda suck, and I suspect it has something to do with the tone curves they're using, but if I can get the parts and get it to spit out 16 bit raw data, I would be one happy matt mills.
