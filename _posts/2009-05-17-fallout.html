I write this blog for two reasons, to share pictures and so all the people in my life, no matter how far flung, can get an idea of what's going on in my life. Now, since I had the wreck last tuesday, I've only posted once, just putting up some details and leaving it at that. Since then I've been popping pain pills at regular intervals and working my way through the stack of comic books and movies my friends brought by. Then someone bitches in the comments that I'm boring him. I told him to go fuck himself, because, hey, I deserve a couple days off for the broken back. <br /><br />On the other hand, I do have a few updates to pass along. I got out of the hospital Friday, and promptly took a nap. When I woke up I realized I hadn't looked at my camera in several days, so I pulled it out and found it was broken. My 50mm 1.2 won't autofocus and the mode dial no longer works at all. And the battery door is broken off. The bag I was carrying has a hole in it, too.<br /><br />It's hard to get up and down, but I can walk and stand pretty well, although that does depend on me keeping up with the pain pills- one every four hours and I can move and function pretty well. On the pain meds, I can do most normal stuff.<br /><br />I didn't take any before I went to sleep last night, mostly because I was feeling fine and I really don't like the drugged feeling. This morning, I was regretting that decision, because all of the minor aches had turned to major ones, and it was a task just to sit up in bed. I took pills, and now I'm fine. I can't wait for the day when I don't depend on pills to get around the house. Should be soon.
