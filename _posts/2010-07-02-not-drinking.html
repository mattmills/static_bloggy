<p>So, I haven&#8217;t had anything to drink in three or four days, and I&#8217;m stating to notice a difference. I can type faster; My pool game is better; I see pictures just a little quicker, focus better. My memory too, it seems improved. But it took me until today to really see any improvement, even a subjective one. I like it; it&#8217;s like the moment when I got my first pair of glasses and could actually see better. Drinking is fun, but this might be better. I figure some moderate consumption won&#8217;t hurt me, but I&#8217;m gonna keep going for at least a week, see what happens.Anyway, photos coming soonish.</p>
