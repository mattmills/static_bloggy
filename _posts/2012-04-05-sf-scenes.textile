This was the first time I've been to San Francisco (since my first visit to the city back in high school) that I've felt like I got anything approaching an understanding with the city. The scale of it always threw me off in the past, for some reason. There was a mental parallax, if you will, between what I was expecting and what I was seeing. I think I've got a better alignment now.
