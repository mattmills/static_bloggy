this is always on my mind. For a very long time, I've been casting about, trying to find my way through the world, and it's been a ripping good time. I've got a good job now, one that will eventually afford me a great deal of freedom, assuming I don't get tied down with a wife and kids and mortgage and all the trappings of modern life that are really just a trap. <br /><br />It's a curve though. I'm starting at zero: zero knowledge of the stuff I'm doing, zero time to do anything but sleep and work, zero money, and zero photos taken since I started the job on tuesday. these will all help each other though: As I learn the job, I'll have more time to get out and do things; as soon as I have a paycheck, I'll have more money in hand than I've had in months; and of course, there will be more photos. (I just checked; there are a couple photos on the camera, but nothing of consequence). <br /><br />one thing, I guess: I've realized that you don't have to be all one thing; that is, you can do a lot of different things, do them well, and it's not that you're letting go of one thing for another, it's that you're able to do both, and that all of your activities inform one another. It's a good thing I've come to this realization, because it's a really bad time to be trying to make money off of photography. (I'm not going to go into details, but someone was pissed at me recently because they thought I was putting out a certain photo for a profit, and it made me laugh. I've never made money off of what I consider my real work, the portraits, the documentary projects, etc).
