I don't always steal my post titles from Tom Waits songs, but when I do, it's because these pictures all came from taking the long way home. I've been experimenting with my commute, seeing what route is the most enjoyable. So far, MUNI to the transbay bus is the best, but the perambulations help.

Actually, I think these are from just before thanksgiving, when Sophia's mom was in town. I was wandering a bit, but I was also trying to get to a restaurant in north beach. Some semi-touristy place, staffed by rude old men. Good food though.
