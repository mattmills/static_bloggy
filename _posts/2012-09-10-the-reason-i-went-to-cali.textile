It's been a while coming, but here are the photos of Ash's birthday, which was the <strike>excuse</strike> reason I went out there anyway. That and I really wanted to get out of OKC for a bit. 

It was a fun night, that started with food trucks and ran on through several bars, and ended with me getting poisoned. Or something. I wasn't _that_ drunk, and I work up with the worst possible hangover. As in I was suffering all day, worse than any other hangover I've ever had. Got up at noon, and drove home. Had to dose myself with coffee and coconut water and a bagel to get moving. 

It was a pretty drive, as drives in the american west usually are.
