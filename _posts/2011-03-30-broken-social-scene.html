<p>went out to tulsa, got to see a really good show. Broken social sceneplayed. I&#8217;d heard <span class="caps">BSS</span> at parties, on the spy, etc, and a bunch of friends were going. So I went, not quite on a whim, but only with a couple days notice. Good show, good brunch the day after. I was sad that I didn&#8217;t even try to take my camera into the venue. A friend told me that they weren&#8217;t letting people with cameras in and so I didn&#8217;t try; turns out they didn&#8217;t care. And I could have been in the front row, too. Oh well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my photographic output has dropped from little to nothing. had a bad shoot with KJ and just haven&#8217;t shot a thing in the week and a half since. It&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s fault, really, that the shoot went badly. I should have seen that what were doing wouldn&#8217;t work, though. It&#8217;s like I need to completely start from scratch and learn to shoot pictures all over again, and forget all the things I&#8217;ve learned. Throw away 13 years of experience and start fresh. Or maybe it&#8217;s a change of scene that I need; I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll figure something out.</p>
