So I've finally gotten my film developed, and the first batch is just some random photos. There was another roll of old film I found in a drawer, and I think at least one of these is from that. It's really weird and difficult to be working with files scanned from film automatically. I can't adjust exposure or white balance or any of that good stuff. Oh well, at least they're better than nothing. I can't wait until I get a new body in though. <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
