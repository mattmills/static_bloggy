<p>Christa needed photos for her real world audition or something, and I&#8217;d been looking to do some kind of shoot for a while, something that got me away from the usual available-darkeness-drunk-friends schtick. My brother (the real one in <span class="caps">ABQ</span>) had just sent me some new lights, stands and umbrellas-2 of each, in fact. So we got together and did this in about an hour in my living room.</p>
