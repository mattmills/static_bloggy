not really. I just feel good because I'm drunk. oh, drunkblogging. and making up words.<br /><br />So I went out to the bar tonight to celebrate the <a href="http://www.gestaltnews.com">first issue</a> and I sit at the bar next to these two chicks, Melodi and Kat, all decked out prettylike and pretty soon we're talking and I'm like whoa hold on and I run out to the car to get my camera.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />So, I get back in and I'm like "Can I get a picture?" and they're like sure, no problem, so I get a couple snaps. Then I hit the head, and make the obligatory self portrait. hey, hanging around Alex nursed my nascent narcissism.  I'm an alliterative drunk. With a spell checker. <br /><br />Anyway, I come back out, realize I'm out of money, and I head home, right after I make another pic of the hotchicks and random dude. Then I got home, thought for a second, grabbed a pack of smokes, and went back, only to find the hotchicks had left. And if any of us hadn't been broke we'd all still be drinking. Last call is right about now in most places in this town. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Oh yeah, the reason I'm still drunk is there's this bottle of wine on my desk, you see. It was helping me do javascript last night and earlier today, and that didn't kill it, but I'm about to. I know that sounds like an alcoholic talking but really I don;t drink that much. It is fun when I do though. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Also, I just found <a href="www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a> which is maybe the most amazing thing on the internet ever. I jumped up and down and scared my cat when I realized what it is. You get to catalogue your books and find people with the same stuff/interests. WOW. And the wine is gone and there are pics to edit for this post. Hope everyone is out there having as good a time as I've been having.
