I don't normally post about work, but when I do, it's because it involved some large quantity of alcohol, usually away from the office... see, for example, the support meetups of yesteryear, or the offsite in Tahoe, or stuff like that. This was a good one. Not too crazy, so I wasn't dying the next day, but enjoyable. Pool playing and drinking good whiskey and good people.
