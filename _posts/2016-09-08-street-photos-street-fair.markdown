Playing catch up as usual. This is just the next 8 photos off the stack; the ones from the street are from some indeterminate afternoon a month and a half ago, and then there are the photos from the Alameda Art walk. Of course I had to take a photo of the "No Photos" lady. Sometimes I can't help myself.
