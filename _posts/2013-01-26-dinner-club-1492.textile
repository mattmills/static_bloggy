A delicious meal with some good folks, once a month. Whoever picks the place for that month has to choose somewhere they've never been; I don't know who chose 1492, (Sophia says it was our friend Dean), but it was a great meal, and someplace I hadn't ever been either. 

I'm trying to think of places to go for next month. So far we've thought Iron Star would be good, or maybe the new green chili place in Yukon. Suggestions? @reply me on twitter, since I'm too lazy to put comments on this blawg.
