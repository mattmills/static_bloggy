<p>seriously, the traffic here is something else. It&#8217;s a big part of what I&#8217;ll take away from here. I&#8217;ll have dreams of the sound of horns and weaving through crowds of pedestrians. Also, crossing the street here is a bitch and a half. The cars in that first picture? Stopped. Then they move a few feet, then they stop again.</p>

<p>If I were a fruit-lover I&#8217;d be set:</p>

<p>Up next, though, we have the antithesis of this: at 7AM, the streets are empty and the light is wonderful. I&#8217;m getting ready to move on from Cairo though. I found out about a really nice beach in a place called Dahab, in the southern Sinai. Cheap Too. I think what I might do is go there for a week and then come back here for a couple days (however long it takes to get my flight arranged) and then head back to the <span class="caps">OKC</span>. That means I&#8217;ll be back around the 20th. That&#8217;s two weeks earlier than I thought I&#8217;d be coming home, but I think I&#8217;ll need that time to make money. Gotta eat, gotta pay rent, etc. Meantime: Gotta rock out. Laters.</p>
