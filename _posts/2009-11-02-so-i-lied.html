I was going to just be lazy and post the photos to flickr and be done, but some of these need captions and comments and snarkiness. Also, I think more people will see them this way. These are split into three posts, so as not to hurt your page load time and my bandwidth.<br /><br />Oh yeah, a technical note- these pictures wouldn't have been possible without clever deployment of the on camera flash and a little reflector to bounce it off of the ceiling/walls. If you want to learn stuff like that, why not come to <a href="http://services.okccoco.com/classes/detail/50">the class I'm teaching at the coco next week</a>? /blatant plug.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Getting ready to race.
