<p>I&#8217;ve been working from the <a href="http://okccoco.com" target="_blank">OKC CoCo</a> for the last month or so now, and it&#8217;s a really great environment. I mean, not to sound like an advertisement. The concept of it is solid, though. Mostly, it&#8217;s getting work done, but there are all these really smart people around, also working, to bounce ideas off of and build relationships with. Most places I go it&#8217;s very hard to talk about my day job, the things I have to bitch about don&#8217;t even make sense to people who haven&#8217;t struggled with what turns out to be a missing } 300 lines up for hours. Anyway, yeah:

Full disclosure: I get my membership in exchange for shooting events for the CoCo.</p>
