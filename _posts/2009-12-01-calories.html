I just found out that 20% of the calories you burn are burned by your brain. Does that mean, then, that people with super high metabolism can think more and/or faster? Endurance athletes: ultramarathon runners, touring cyclists who do 80+ miles a day, anybody at the olympics, people like that. Can prolonged exercise make you smarter just by making the processor run hotter?
