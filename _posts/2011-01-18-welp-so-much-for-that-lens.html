<p>I just spent the last hour putting the finishing touches on a repair that I started <a href="http://www.notuntitled.com/articles/2010/10/14/saga-of-the-lens/">way back when</a>. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s nothing physically wrong with the lens; I had it in <a href="http://instagr.am/p/BDQJn/">many pieces</a>, far enough into the guts to find any physical defect, and there were none. So, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong with the lens. It works fine in manual focus, and I&#8217;m tempted to sell it on ebay as such. then again, having a backup 50 is never a bad idea. Photo evidence (sorry for the crappy phone pic):</p>
