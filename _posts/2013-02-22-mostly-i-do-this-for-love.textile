This was some saturday night, when we'd either ridden bikes or some one else was driving, and I let myself get comepletely smashed. Not hard at the Hilo. I love these people, and I love good loud rock music. It feels excessively sentimental, but if I can't be that way on my second to last day in town, when can I?
