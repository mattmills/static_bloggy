description: "Some thoughts about perspective"
---

This is a set of photos that I shot the other day, after having lunch with sophia. The first photo is just something I shot on the way, and quite liked. The second two I shot after, walking on that broad area above the falls at Buena Vista gardens. I thought to myself, "What a nice change in perspective," and followed that with trying to think of how to change perspectives when I was walking down the street? I remembered the flippy screen on my camera did live view and I could use it as a waist level finder. It worked surprisingly well. Not exactly like having a waist level groundglass, more like a sport finder, where you know mostly where the camera is pointed, and what's in the frame. 

The first thing that it did was it allowed me to get closer to people. I don't know why, but I'm pretty bashful when taking random people's pictures. I super don't want to get in someone's face with the camera. When I know people, it's somewhat different, but on the street, it's a problem. If you know anything about photography, you know that the first thing is to get closer to your subjects, to fill the frame. Not to say that there is nothing but subject in the frame, but that the entire frame is used for the subject. I don't know that I've been perfectly effective at that here, but it's a start. I may try a wider lens with this technique.
