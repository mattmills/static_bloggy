I've been lazy, but hey, everybody deserves a break now and then. Had another crash yesterday, broke my helmet but my head survived. Just a little road rash. Mostly I have pictures.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />KW's costume wins, on several levels. Scariest, most likely to give small children nightmares, best use of crutches, the list goes on.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />I didn't take this one, sorry to dissappoint. It is pretty cool though.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Cat Girl, sorry I forgot your name. Rachel? that sounds right.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Ken in his natural habitat. Swinging an axe.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />And this girl said she hates pictures of herself. What is is with beautiful people that say that?<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Lauren, goofing off at Pho Hua.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />A little mirror action.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />And finally my new rear wheel. The front is in my home made truing stand as we speak, waiting for me to get off my lazy ass and finish it. Meanwhile, Life is good and I'm drinking beer. Later folks.
