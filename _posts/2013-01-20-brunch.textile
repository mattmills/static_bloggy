Sophie's birthday brunch, a week after the fact. In which I didn't get a good picture of my girlfriend. And with these, I'm back to being two months behind. On the good news list, I've got my storage box up and running. So things should have some regularity here from now on (says the guy who's moving cross country in five weeks).
