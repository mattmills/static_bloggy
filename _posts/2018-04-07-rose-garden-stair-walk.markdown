This was, I think, the day before Thanksgiving? Sophie's mom and also Serena were in town, and we had an afternoon to kill. She's been around here enough that all the regular tourist stuff was played out, so we did something more local-ish. The stair walks are from a book, _Secret Stairs: East Bay_. I believe it's a series, even. Anyway, there are detailed instructions for how to find the trail for what amounts to an urban hike. This one starts and ends at the Berkeley Rose Garden.

As you might imagine, there are a lot of stairs, but it's a reasonable balance of up and down, such that I didn't feel too strained (he says, 6 months later). There were a couple really amazing, sweeping panoramic views of the bay. I've only put one here, just because when you've seen one spectacular sunset photo from roughly the same square mile of the hills, you've seen them all. The experience of coming around a corner and looking to your side to see it, that never gets old.

_edit: added another sentence so the last graph doesn't trail off_
