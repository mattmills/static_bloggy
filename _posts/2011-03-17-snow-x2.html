<p>My photos from the first snow storm were a little too depressing&#8230; not in that they were bad, but you can tell looking at them that I feel like shit. Since I feel a lot better now (o hai spring), I&#8217;m leaving them out. But these, from the second storm, are better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, everything is moving along. Haven&#8217;t gotten any closer on planning those shoots I wanted to do. I need to email a bunch of people, I suppose, and gather all the supplies I&#8217;ll need. Lights. A stuffed wolf or puma. A stone spearhead. A stick. Model. Location. Storyboards, maybe even.</p>
