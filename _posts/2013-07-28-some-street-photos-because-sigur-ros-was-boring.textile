I know, I know, it's been a long time since I've blogged. There are ~500 images in my backlog, though, and my computer situation has finally stabilised to the point that I can blog again. 

These are all from the night we went to see sigur ros, the band with the made up language. All I could think, the whole time, was, "God I wish this were Radiohead, they'd be so much better." On the plus side, we got to have some good sushi in the city, and Sophie enjoyed the show, so there's that.

at some point in this series of posts, there may be a narrative breakdown, but there will always be some good photos. Don't worry, I'm just trying to get things online in a way that makes sense to me.
