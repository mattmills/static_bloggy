Early December, and I'm  skipping a few pictures only to maybe come back to them later. This was when Mary was in town, too, although I didn't get a decent photo of her (a failure on my part). Anyway, this was the day I learned about Buckfast. This is a tonic wine for winos, I guess. In the words of Ronan, "If you drink the whole bottle, you're going to do some crime." I tried it, but didn't get enough to even cause jaywalking.
