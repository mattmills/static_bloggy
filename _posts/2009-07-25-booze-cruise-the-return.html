So last night was the first booze cruise I've been to in months... between time off the bike and booze cruise itself kind of dying out, it just hasn't happened. I don't know about anybody else, but a week doesn't seem complete without riding my bike around on a friday night and getting smashed. So I did. Unfortunately, the night was ruined at the end, the second or third stolen purse at blue note. Sucks. The photos weren't all that great, I wasn't really focused, but as always, there are a few cool things. Anyway, next up is a post from barcamp okc, which is going on right now.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Casey at rooster.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newbc/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Faye terrorizing Ken.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newbc/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Faye and M____, who's name I should remember, but I don't.
