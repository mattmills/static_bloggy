The first photo is actually of the view from our hotel window; really harsh light after sleeping in. This was definitely the day the doldrums set in for me; we just kind of wandered a bit, didn't do a lot-- wait, no. That was the first couple hours. Then we went to the robot restaurant, which is another post entirely, and for which I may have to once again pull out the slideshow functionality I was using earlier. This part of the day was very harsh light that I somehow forced to cooperate in a few places.

I said it on twitter, and I'll say it again here: Sometimes winning is just deciding to keep going. Not to have an income doing something you love, or to be recognized and justly famous (or even known by the people in your sub-sub-sub specialty). ["To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45392/ulysses) Just keep going. Do the things you need to do. Do what you have to to live, but hold on to that other stuff too. If you have to start and stop a project 10 times, if it takes you 5 years instead of 5 days, hold fast, keep at it.

In other (related) news, I'm thinking about starting up PROJECT SAN PABLO again. Photography is my thing, but the project really animates it. I don't know. Nothing else is really suggesting itself. I need to make a routine out of going and shooting. Find people, and then find people that might be able to help me find other people. Maybe I'll try the library.
