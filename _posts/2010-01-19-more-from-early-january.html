Because if I don't just do one big post with these, I'll never get them all out, and that would be a tragedy. These are somewhat random; I find myself going out a lot at night. It's the insomnia more than anything; since I'm going to be up anyway, I figure I might as well not be sitting at home bored to death. And I know I've been saying that I want to get away from the 'photos of drunk friends' (or drunken photos of friends) thing, but here they are again anyway. I drink, I take pictures, it's bound to happen. The last photo Kat took, by the way. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
