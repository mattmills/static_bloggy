this was a very nice evening with some new friends here in the bay. Really great folks. D&C are the same pair we went to Yosemite with a couple weekends ago. Really fun couple, I'm glad we met them.

So. We're in the new house, and I've got my computer and network up. The RAID came up just fine, and everything else seems as well; wifi works, at least. There's a lot of unpacking, organizing, and laying out of furniture to be done, but home is where "127.0.0.1":http://127.0.0.1 is.
