I took my camera to the grocery store. I have an idea: to make interesting pictures when nothing is happening. It's a weird personal barrier I have, a switch that is either on or off in my head; if it doesn't seem to me like anything is happening, then nothing is. Of course, something is always happening, "the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock."
