<p>Not about these photos, which are decent. I&#8217;m going to a rally today, in solidarity with the people in wisconsin. It&#8217;s another one of those moments in history. Revolutions across the world. Protests here in the US. People who are nostalgic for the late 60&#8217;s, wake up and get your ases down to the capitol. It&#8217;s a good time to be alive. And it is Oklahoma. Not a lot likely to happen here. (I know I just jinxed myself. The knowing negates it). But still, anything can happen. Anyway, enjoy the photos and pay attention to twitter for updates on the ground.</p>
<p>(edit: decided I didn&#8217;t like that first photo. poof! like it was never there). <br />
