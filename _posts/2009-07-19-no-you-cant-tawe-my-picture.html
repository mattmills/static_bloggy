dear lookatokc photographer,<br /><br />No, you can't take my picture. Yes, I'm also a working photographer (for a given value of working), no, that doesn't mean we really have anything in common. You take party pics, i take pictures of my friends at parties. You use a flash when you don't need it, I hate it even when I absolutely have to use it. You have a huge camera bag weighing you down with shit you don't need, I only own two lenses. All of these are strikes against you, but really, it's just that I don't like having my picture taken. <br /><br />Some of us don't want to be in the paper. I might be the only one, but I'd wager there are at least a few people out there who like anonymity. Or who need it. <br /><br />Certainly there's little value in party pics, hell, I take thousands myself and put them on this shitty blog, but the big difference is that I know the people that I take pictures of, for the most part. I feel weird not knowing people and taking their picture. It's knowing the people that lets me get closer, get a little more meaning in the phototographs than the standard grin and grab-the-person-next-to-you. Some of them, at least (yes, there are a few posed pics here on the blog and more on my facebook, but those are here for the people in them, not for me to show off).<br /><br />
