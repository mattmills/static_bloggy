So "@ryukochan":http://twitter.com/#!/ryukochan, (Anne to her friends) said, I'm bored with my avatar, and so I suggested a photoshoot... next thing you know we're planning a shoot out in the woods. The idea was for her to get lost in the woods and go from civilized and contained to completely unrestrained and feral. I have more photos, but I'm not publishing just everything yet, because I'm thinking I might submit it a few places. Fun shoot, anyway.
