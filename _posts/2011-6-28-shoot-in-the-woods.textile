so, I had been talking with this girl, "@ryukochan":http://twitter.com/#!/ryukochan on twitter, Anne to her friends, and she said, I'm bored with my avatar, and so I suggested a photoshoot... next thing you know we're planning a shoot out in the woods. The idea was for her to get lost in the woods and go from civilized and contained to completely unrestrained and feral. I have more photos, but I'm not publishing just everything yet, because I'm thinking I might submit it a few places.
