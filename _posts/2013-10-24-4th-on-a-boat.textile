This is how I spent my 4th of July; on Seemant's boat, drinking and waiting for fireworks that never came. Or, when they did, were far off in the distance (that shot was through my 500mm lens, and the only one that was remotely sharp). There was drinking, and there were photos, so I was pretty happy with how it all came out.

This was the second time the _Jillpot_ sailed, incidentally. It's now known also as the "truth boat." Weather it's know for that beacuse you think you're going to sink and become deathbed honest or not is up for question; I have not sailed on it under either name.
