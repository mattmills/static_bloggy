Ended up at sauced friday, and didn't have time to post these yesterday. some people might say that makes me a bad blogger, but they need to get a life. The band is called, I think, The Double Clutchers. I could tell they were having fun, not a bad sound, but a lot of covers. I enjoyed it.<br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/threeguys/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/threeguys/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/threeguys/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/threeguys/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />This girl is not a member of the band. Rule of thumb: stripes = trouble. She's not wearing paisley, that's all I'm sayin'. <br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/threeguys/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
