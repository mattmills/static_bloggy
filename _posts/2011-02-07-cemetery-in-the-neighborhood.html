<p>well, not my neighborhodd, but the one I was staying in&#8230; I conceived a big typology type project while I was there. All the cemeteries of New Orleans. Of course, I&#8217;d have to live there&#8230; if the city doesn&#8217;t sink before I get the chance to move there, that is. It&#8217;d be a couple years. When I&#8217;m looking to semi-retire or something. or when I get a wild hair and have to light out. Although, as my local friends advised me, it&#8217;d be easier if I picked a subset to look at. I could spend a long time looking at these angels, for example.</p>
