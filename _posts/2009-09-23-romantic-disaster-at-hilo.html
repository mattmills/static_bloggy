Romantic disaster is a local band that's doing amazing things. They've got a great sound and a great look, the kind that even comes through when they're all wasted and playing a quick set at an AIDS benefit show at a dive like the HiLo. In fact, it probably added to the rawness and unpredictability of the whole thing. Of course, your humble blogger was drunk off his ass, so maybe I was just responding to the visceral loudness and hotness of their lead singer. But I've heard them play before, when I was sober and so were they, and they're good. Put them on your list of bands to catch, and then someday, you can be like, "I saw them in this tiny ass club in OKC. The bassist used to make my pizza." Oh wait, that's me. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
