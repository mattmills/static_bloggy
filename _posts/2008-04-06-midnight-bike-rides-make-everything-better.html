I just rode 25 miles, thither and yon and back again, here in oak shitty (that's oklahoma city, for those not in the know). I feel a lot better. So, thanks, Alex, for introducing to me how awesome they are.<br /><br />One thing about this town: the wind is fucking killer. As in, it will kill you sometimes, whether you're watching or not. I was almost knocked over a couple of times by gusts. I have to wonder if anyone here does a wind blog, with all sorts of wind related ephemera?  Wind jokes,  stats, photos,  videos... hmm.<br /><br />Anyway, about halfway through my ride, I was crossing the highway on an overpass, and I saw these signs. The wind knocked them over, I swear.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Just the road...<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Self-portrait in black and white. Feeding my narcissism. This was from another night, but on the card anyway.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>My parents at dinner yesterday. Mom's a little blurry, but don't worry, it's just iced tea she's drinking.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
