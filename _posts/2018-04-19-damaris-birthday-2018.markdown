This was something like two months ago? Shortly after I got back from Irvine, anyway. It was Damaris' birthday, and there were a bunch of folks over at their house to celebrate. Really fun time.

Missed a couple days' blogging there. It's interesting how easy it is to fall out of the habit of doing this thing. Something I have to push myself to do. I know, I'm being lazy with these, but the lighting was super mixed and tricky, so here they are in black and white.
