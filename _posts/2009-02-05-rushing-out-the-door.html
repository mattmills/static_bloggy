First off, I'm writing this in a bit of a rush, scratching off that last to do item from my list before I hit the door. The Regular Wednesday sesh was a lot of fun; not only did we hit the litter box, but we rode around and hit some spots as well. Down by the chase building, a little bricktown love, and then we rocked up the monster hill. It's the only monster in town, another sign that OKC isn't a real city. Anyway, photos:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I love how everyone's starting to get the no handed shit down pat, or at least look good for the thirtieth of a second I need to get the photos. Nice to see hornbeck in town, too, and on his new whip no less.<br /><br />So anyway, that's all folks, I'm out. I'm going to try to shoot and post from the road, we'll see how well that works. I'll be twittering, at least. On the flip side.
