I'm still editing the next big batch of photos; these cover from just before thanksgiving through new years. A pretty big batch, not like the old days where I'd pull out the card every day and see what had happened right in front of me. I'm starting something tonight; for every blog post I also make a print. The third image is tonight's print. Of course, my printer is nearly out of ink, but I've found a cheaper alternative for that, so hopefully I'll be printing more soon.
