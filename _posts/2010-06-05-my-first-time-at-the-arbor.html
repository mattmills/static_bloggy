<p>It&#8217;s a sweet space. Really big, and then had a lot of cool shit there for the show, plus some live work too. Some painters painting during the show for our entertainment. Which, come to think of it, is a little odd. Painting isn&#8217;t usually performative, but I was entertained. <br/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/may10/0016.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/may10/0017.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/may10/0018.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/may10/0019.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/></p>
