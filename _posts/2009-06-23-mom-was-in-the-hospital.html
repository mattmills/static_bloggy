for once, i actually managed to Shoot pictures of mom from start to finish in the hospital. This visit was more than a little silly. She had a non-specific infection, possbly blood, possibly kidney, but they made her stay in the hospital for 4 days when she could have stayed at home. Ostensibly it was to monitor her, but I don' think we would have done a worse job of that at home. Add to that the stress factor of being in the hospital, and the whole thing was kind of ridiculous. <br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">Mom the day she went to the dialysis clinic with a fever.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">The first cultures, which were the only ones that came back positive.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">Hallway going into Presbyterian Tower, OU Med center. </span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">Mom coming back from the vending machines.
