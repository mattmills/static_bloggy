Something about the moonlight through the trees in winter is especially magical. Or it could just be that I'm outside to see it. The phone booth is one of several on the OU campus; when I saw them I was really excited, and thought of doing a whole essay on them right then. But I had to get to the Dan Savage talk, which ended up being a packed house. Really great, really moving. Then we went and had pizza, and the phone booths seemed less photogenic on the way out.
