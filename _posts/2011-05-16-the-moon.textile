Oy vey, what a couple of weeks. Shooting the moon. Shooting the Sun. Shooting whatever looks good. It's been nice. But I've realized over the past couple days that there are at least a few people that still want to see photos here. So, without further ado, I will be posting a bunch of shit from the last couple weeks, as usual, and as I can.
