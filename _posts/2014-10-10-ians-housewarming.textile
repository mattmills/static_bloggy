This was about 3 weeks ago? Maybe 4? Anyway, Ian and Stephanie moved recently, close enough that we sometimes run into each other walkiing home from Bart. The housewarming was a lot of people I didn't know, so I did what I usually do: get drunk and take a bunch of pictures. It was a lot of fun. Note that I didn't do a ton of processing on these; just applied a contrast curve and convert to B/W.
