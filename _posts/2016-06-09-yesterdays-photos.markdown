description: "Some photos from yesterday"
---

So yesterday I finally figured out what the motor drive was for: it's for getting more pictures, faster than your finger can go. I know some of these are similar, and that I should probably cut a few, but that takes time that I don't have. I know I should point the camera a bit lower, looking at all of these. Anyway, I just wanted to get up a post, so people know that I'm not dead and the blog is still active. Still shooting.

I may try to do this every day, just pull the card from the camera and upload anything good. The through line, the narrative of these photos is pretty raw, and won't make a ton of sense. I feel like if a larger theme emerges it's going to happen after the blogging, when I'm printing in six months, or looking back on this in five years. (Also god I've had this blog in some form for going on 8 years? I blame [@busblog](http://twitter.com/busblog)).
