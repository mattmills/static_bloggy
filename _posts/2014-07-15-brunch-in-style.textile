Man, Portal. This was many moons ago, and I don't remember the specifics. One of the problems of a two month delay between shooting pictures and getting them put up here is that the little details sort of slip away. Maybe I should take notes or something, keep a daybook. Anyway, what I do remember is that it was a good afternoon, sitting in the sun for hours after a great meal with good people all around.
