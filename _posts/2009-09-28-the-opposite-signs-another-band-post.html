I swear I'm not turning into <a href="http://jeremycharles.com">Jeremy Charles</a>, or worse, Annie Leibowitz, but I do seem to be shooting a lot of musicians lately. This band I didn't really like. The sound was super mellow, smooth jazz like, and it really did nothing for me. There were some good moments, when it seemed like a song would break out and do something interesting, but then it got drowned in the hopeless drone. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
