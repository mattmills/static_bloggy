<p>Please wake me up in my dreams.&quot; Just rediscovering how awesome an album &#8220;Frank&#8217;s Wild Years&#8221; is. Seriously, you should give it a listen. Also &#8220;Romeo is Bleeding&#8221; off of Blue Valentine, very good. Merry Christmas, happy blah blah. Another post coming soon; this won&#8217;t satisfy my blogging addiction for today.</p>
