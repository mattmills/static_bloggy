I've been sort of debating the whole film thing, and really the things that appeal to me about it are not really the film aspect as much as the form factor of shooting with a rangefinder. I don't like scanning or developing film, but I do like shooting with the CLE, and to an extent, I like the tonality I get out of the film cameras, too, although that's a toss up; as I've said, it's something I can do with the digital files if I want, but it's also pushing against the strengths of the material. 

So, I don't have the camera here, but what I do have is a pile of files. So I went back through them and found a few more that I liked. I'm in a place now where I'm thinking what I thought were problems with the camera may have just been me not being used to its quirks. So I might just plunk down the 7k and get one sometime in the next decade or so. Starting saving.... now. 

In the meantime, I'm going to develop the film that I have and go back to shooting mostly with the fuji.
