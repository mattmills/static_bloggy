Never though this blog would make it this long. But then I also thought I'd be long gone from oklahoma too. Anyway, It's been an interesting four days, to say the least. I got my new camera on wednesday, and I couldn't be happier with it. The D700 is an amazing machine; it makes everything that I do easier and pushes the realm of photographic possibility farther than I'd thought possible. Yeah, it's that good. <br /><br />That was my first delay; I was having too much fun with the new camera to blog. Then the power went out in my neighborhood overnight, and there was no internet; then, finally, just as I got these photos edited, i spilled a coffee into my macbook, ruining it. so now they're re-edited, and here for your enjoyment. <br /><br />Next post: look for the gratuitous cat photos (not what you think). <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/firstd700/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/firstd700/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/firstd700/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/firstd700/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/firstd700/0005.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/firstd700/0006.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>
