<p>This was a couple sundays ago. Man was I tired. Actually, these might have been on two different days, but at least they feel like the same day. The way the days have been run together the last couple of weeks, I&#8217;m not even sure which way is up sometimes. Maybe it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m really tired right now, too.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had the air conditioner on in my house since the weather first cooled off on tuesday. Why waste money? It&#8217;s so nice outside I&#8217;m just letting that good air in. The smell reminds me of the mountains, the air around santa fe. Strong memories, good times. Here and now, the only way to be.</p>
