So, in September, I went back to OK for a week to get hitched. Can I say how weird it was to be back? Going home is weird, because it's not even home anymore. Home is a moving target of associations, friends, places I sleep, places I go  out to, and all the things that are normal. The way I get up in the morning and take the train. The way my shower works. There are ten thousand little things which make up 'home'. Anyway, enough blather. PHOTOS:
