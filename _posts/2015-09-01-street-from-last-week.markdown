I know, it's tuesday already. I got these ready to post yesterday, but when I got home I had to start getting ready for Bali, which is in 2 days. 2! Days! Super stoked. I love getting on a plane and going somewhere I've never been. There's always this really nice moment of getting completely lost. It's the moment I'm most at home.
