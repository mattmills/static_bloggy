<p>er, something like that. a drive by blogging, maybe. Quick and painless as long as nobody tries to be a hero, OK?</p>
<p>Shoot from the other day went ok. Not brilliant or life changing but some decent photos. This is another thing I do: I hate everything I&#8217;ve shot until at least a week after I shot it. Sometimes more like a month. This is why I&#8217;m such a procrastinator. It takes me a month get it out of my system that I suck and just put the photos out there.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got a new domain, <a href="http://photounrelated.com">photounrelated.com</a>, that points here for now but might point to a new blog, or I might rename this one and start using that domain, I&#8217;m not sure. I&#8217;m always writing about one thing and showing photos from another.</p>
<p>This night had a color phase and then a black and white phase. It went that way because, as I&#8217;ve said before, the Drunken Fry is badly lit. Or at least very dimly lit. Weird night, anyway.</p>
