I'm proud to announce that as of this post I'm _less than three months behind_. Seriously, this is a milestone for me, and I'm really thankful for all the people that helped me along my way. Seriously, three months sounds like a lot, but I'n basically leapfrogging september; All I have are a few film shots and the wedding. 

This was what the evenings looked like. Hanging out in the net shelter, to keep out the bugs. Playing games, eating, reading. Totally exactly what I needed.
