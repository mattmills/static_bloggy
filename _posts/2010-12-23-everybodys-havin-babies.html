<p>er, well, it seems that way. Katie wanted some pinup-like pictures, which I&#8217;m not posting, and some more normal ones, which are below. This was a fun shoot. As for the babies, four (five? six? depending on how close of a friend we&#8217;re talking about) friends of varying closeness have had kids in the last 6 months, and several more are expecting. None for me, thanks.</p>
