So this was a nice day. Brunch and then a hella twisty drive through Marin to the beach. I didn't think it was that bad, but Soph and her mom got a little carsick, and wouldn't let me drive back. I suppose a year of hardly driving day-to-day has taken its toll on my skills. 

Our luck was up, and the sky was clear and blue (as opposed to the fog that could have come in). We basically laid there and listened to the surf for an hour, and then walked to the far end of the beach. We wished for a picnic basket, maybe some beers, but then we went home and had a really big dinner. But going home is the next post.

I did something with the editing process. I decided to cut all the ones without people about halfway through. It seems sort of arbitrary, but it immediately focused the edit. I used to have a hard rule against photos without people in them. I thought that people were the most interesting thing, and that landscapes and scenic shots were just boring. Of course, I formed that opinion in Oklahoma, where there aren't really landscapes as such.
