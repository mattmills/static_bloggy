I dunno. Haven't blogged in almost a week, but the backlog is still low. Shooting film is super slow, what can I say? I've got some rolls to develop sitting here right now; and a bunch of stuff scanned that I need to get spotted. 

Also, this isn't my only project... I'm once again wearing many hats. Well, at least one, with a Cubs' logo on it.
