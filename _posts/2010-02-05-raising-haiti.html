<p>You should all come out to this show, all proceeds from the door go to the Red Cross Haiti relief effort. <a href="http://www.loveokc.com/calendar/12471932/" target="_blank">Linkage.</a>  RSVP, fuckers. 
<br/>

Although that&#8217;s not much of a slogan, it&#8217;s true. <br/><span class="caption" >Rex, who organized the whole thing. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0023.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ><a href="http://twitter.com/oh_tootie" target="_blank">@oh_tootie</a> at the first show.
