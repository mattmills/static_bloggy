<p>I&#8217;m sure someone else will move in and civilize the place now and it won&#8217;t be the hell house any more. This was a good way to go out though, beating a couch into submission with an axe and then burning it in the back yard, and then the fire trucks show up&#8230; yeah. I&#8217;ll miss it a little. That night with the fire was a perfect end to it for me: the right mix of madness and fun and hilarity, and also danger of decapitation/third degree burns.</p>
