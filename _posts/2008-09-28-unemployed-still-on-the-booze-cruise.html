This is amazing:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>That's Adam, the one that fell off the bridge a little less than three months ago. I'm amazed he's walking, but back on a bike, even for a few feet? His range of motion and flexibility are phenomenal. I'd still be in bed eating ice cream.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Mike showed up too, which was nice. Haven't seen him in a while.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>KW, with the tall bike. That's two bikes welded one on top of the other, for those who don't know.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Neil. Crazier than this picture: we went to high school together and didn't realize.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Random, and more random.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-7.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Regan, or Raygun, or something like that. Hates photos of herself.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-8.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-8.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Sarah, this chick at the sidecar (bar here in the city) riding the tallbike. She's supposed to email me and I'm then supposed to email her the pic. Sarah, if you happen to find this, feel free to steal it from here, too. (That goes for anyone who's image is here. If it's you, and you want to take the pic and do whatever with it, go ahead).<br /><br />And I'm mostly broke now. If I pay my bills, that is. If not, I've got cash to last a little while.I should pay them and then look for work. That's what I'll do. Yeah.
