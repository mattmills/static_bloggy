I swear I don't mean to be dribbling out these photos one at a time, but the last two days... well, I got the flu (thanks, flu shot, for nothing), and my RAID had to be rebuilt. Luckily for me, adding a disk back to the raid is all automagic, because I've been pretty worthless otherwise.

In any case, I'm alive, and hopefully tomorrow I'll be back at it.
