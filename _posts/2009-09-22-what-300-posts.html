Yeah, I'm as shocked as you are. Some of those are drafts that were never published, but still... a year and a half and three hundred posts later, we're still here. Wow. This one sort of snuck up me. It seems like just a couple weeks ago I had the 250th post. But no. Anyway, some random photos before we get to fair stuff and bike race later today.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >I don't have enough superlatives for the meal I had at Musashi's last thursday. The show was fun, but the kobe beef there is tied for the best steak I've ever had. The fried rice was also really good. I like places that pay attention to their staples.</span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/allatonce/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Yeah, ooh, pretty fire.
