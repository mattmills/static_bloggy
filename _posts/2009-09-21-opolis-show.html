Went down to norman with Chelsea (and now she has a twitter so I can link that: <a href="http://twitter.com/thenakedsun">@thenakedsun</a>) and took photos of the band "Deer People" (or is that "The Deer People"?) and anyway, hated the photos when I first looked, but really these aren't that bad. There's a second band down there, Mayola, they were good too. Louder and more energetic, but a lot simpler musically. I liked both. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >On the way to Norman.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0024.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Oh yeah, there were random firedancers.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0025.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >And then the sky opened up.

I was there covering Deer People, so naturally I have a lot of pictures of them.

I don't know about you, but sometimes really high energy three-chord rock is what the doctor ordered. And their bassist is a badass. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0045.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0046.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0047.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
