The weekend went hard. 12 hours of work on saturday on the watch board, and 8 hours of drinking on sunday. There was no time to blog. Still, if this is a four day a week enterprise, that's not too bad. I may also start posting some things from the backlog, beacuse my daily grind is a lot of the same old construction, busses, and sidewalks.
