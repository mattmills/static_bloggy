and thereÅ› a good reason for that actually. My pecious MacbookÂ´s hard dive died. I maen, like,  really dead. Making bac clicking and hig pitched grinding noises, dead. So Im blogging from the handheld while a new install of mac osx is working. Luckily for me, I have a ton of hard drives sort of laying around. I spent about half of last night (when I was supposed to go out and have a beer) trying to download and install <a href=http://www.ubuntu.org>Ubuntu</a>, but for some reason the install disk didnÂ´t work in either my momÂ´Å› laptop or mine. Then, while I was trying to find a 6-pin to 4-pin firewire adapter, I found the restore disks for my current laptop, which Id assumed were gone forever. By then it was 3qam though, and so I went to sleep. Which explains why Im doing an install in the afternoon.<br /><br />Had My interview to be a plumber yesterday. It went pretty well, although I shouldnÂ´t have mentioned my photography, for some reason the guys doing the interview couldntÂ´understand how someone could be two things at once. The answer, of course, is very carefully if at all. <br /><br />WeÂ´Äºl see. I got 10th on the list and 8 have already been called, which means IÂ´m #2 on the list right now. I dont really want to go out as a plumbing apprentice. Seems boring. Welding on the other hand is the magic that holds the world together, quite literally. The interview for that is tomorrow. I know what not to say this time too.
