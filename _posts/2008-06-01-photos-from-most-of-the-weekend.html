OK, so before I run off and do more crazy shit, the photos and some more story need to go here. So before I was having all those metaphysical doubts, I got home Friday and then turned around and went out to the Rooster to see who would be around and generally  drink. before that though, I ran by best buy and picked up my new ipod, 16gb touch. I actually like it quite a lot, the battery lasts a lot longer than my n800 and the volume goes up louder. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0529-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0529-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Got there to the booze cruise, and it turned out to be mostly booze, which was nice after a fairly long week. Then my bank card came back declined, despite the paycheck I'd put in earlier that day. It was all good, though, between pitchers and people willing to cover me for the cover at the Blue Note. The band they had as sort of all right as long as you didn't pay them any attention, which was hard as loud as they were. By the time we got there the place was more or less empty except for the bar itself. Magically, beers kept appearing in front of me. I was fairly drunk by the end of the night. I rode home probably faster still than any other time, maybe 20 minutes for 8 miles. No stops. It was nice.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Then I woke up Saturday to go to this bike happening in Mesta Park. I stopped on the way to get a new rear tire, the old one was worn through. Saw Mike, who works at the shop and is an all-around nice guy, said hello, had a coffee next door at coffee slingers, which is really good coffee, by the way, and free wifi to boot. <br /><br />On to the park, where there were sprints, a slow race, and all sorts of fun things. That wast most of my day, fixie tricks and hanging out and soaking up the sun. I Helped these two girls with their bikes, little things, seat adjustment and brake tension, but it's little things like that which make a ride fun or a pain in the ass.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a> <br /><br />The next stop was this water park on 36th and Classen, public and free, just out there for people to come and cool off. All kinds of ways to get watered. That was one of the more fun parts of the day, and I have no pictures from it. Oh well. Then the whole group went en masse to the infoshop, which is where I started to feel conflicted about my job a little. Oh well, fuck that. Know the world glued your back to the wall, gotta brawl through that, like Jay z said. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-5.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />They were having a barbeque, vegetarian, of course, and I had my first ever veggie burger. Tasteless, bland, and later my stomach was not happy with me. The vibe I was getting from them was weird: sort of slightly superior defensive insular. I left to get smokes, came back, and some people were hanging out inside, and the feeling was different: we were telling jokes and riddles and just hanging out. So I don't know about that whole situation/group/whatever. Of course, they're all individuals and probably cool taken by themselves. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-6.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />And after that I was pretty exhausted, so I came home and went to bed. I know, boring. <br />Nothing else to report, except I'm editing a new portfolio to go up here soon. We'll see how good it looks, I like the pictures at least. Speaking of pictures: here's one last for your visual enjoyment:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-7.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-7.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
