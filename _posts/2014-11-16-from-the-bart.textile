The daily commute. I've been pushing myself lately to make more pictures wherever I can. While I was working heavily on the watch, it seems my creative juices were at a low ebb, or possibly they were all used up. I'm getting back at it, though. Making myself shoot any time I think of it. There's never not time to snap a few photos. If if seems like there isn't, my priorities are out of whack. I used to shoot until I was literally passed out, wake up, take a few frames, and pass out again. Shoot while injured, shoot while dying od dysentery, shoot while on a bus, crashing into a ditch, shoot while digging ourselves out of the ditch.

  bq. For nothing is fixed, forever and forever and forever, it is not fixed; the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock.

  bq. Generations do not cease to be born, and we are responsible to them because we are the only witnesses they have. The sea rises, the light fails, lovers cling to each other, and children cling to us. The moment we cease to hold each other, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out. -_James Baldwin_

  I first came on that quote in a "book that he did with Richard Avedon":http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/nothing-personal/author/richard-avedon/pics/sortby/1/ which I just found out now costs a bazillion dollars. I worked in a photo library and was talking to the librarian, my friend Alison, about how awesome I though Avedon was. As she always did, she pulled down a couple books for me to look at. One of them was _Nothing Personal_, a paperback edition. I read the essay, which I never did; the words drew me in. Baldwin didn't talk about the photos but about the experience of being a black man walking down the street with a white man (in 1964, not that it's different now). And then some other things happened (It has been nearly ten years and I don't remember most of the essay), and it ends on the above poem.

  It had an effect on me that I can't fully explain. That moment when you read something that says something you already know, but more clearly and concisely than you could have ever said. Ferlinghetti was like that, at least a few of his, and some Tennyson as well. Roethke, "'The Waking'":http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172106 was a lifeline during the worst days of insomnia, slowly losing it. The Baldin, though, validated what I wanted to do with my life. Bearing witness. Here was somone, out of the blue, saying that what I was doing was valid, that it wasn't just a waste.
