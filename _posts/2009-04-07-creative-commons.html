Just added a CC tag to the bottom of the blog. I had always meant to, but it slipped my mind until this business with the AP threatening to sue people for quoting, linking, etc. So you know that it is: This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License</a>.
