Mike J's. At the Sipango. And you might think, from these pictures, that it's not a bad place to hang out. You'd be wrong. I wouldn't go there again unless it's someone's birthday, and they won't see reason and come to a bar with less dudebros. The things we do for our friends. Actually, I only stayed for half an hour, everybody was already pretty well wasted by the time I got there. Although I did have dinner and some beers earlier at Mcnellies that night, I wasn't <span >drinking</span>, if you know what I mean. Tuesday, you know? <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
