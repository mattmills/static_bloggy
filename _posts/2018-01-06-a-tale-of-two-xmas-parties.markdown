So, I was messing around with my old XPro, and discovered that I'd shot the 2016 Apcera party on it and then forgot about it. I downloaded the pictures, and then saw that I had 2017's party to post too, and well here we are. These were both open bar affairs, so please excuse the blurryness in some of these, the whiskey was very good both years.

The venues were different but the story was mostly the same, except: the first year, I was in the city, so went to the hotel room to hang out while everyone was getting ready, and shot photos out the window. Year two, I was mad late because of traffic getting into the city (since I work from home now).

Coming soon: a few photos from Oklahoma.
