After the photo booth and the rest of the party, Sophie and I cabbed it to a friend's house for another party, filled with people in costume (If you noticed katie was in a Data costume in the last post, that's why). This party was _nuts_. The devil (pictured) was doing palm and tarot readings, there were 500 jello shots when we got there, and a lot less when we left, a couple of dudes dressed as a left and right boob, a fire pit, and a lot of other madness. 

In other words, one hell of a night.
