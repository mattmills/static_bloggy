So I'm headed home today, and I get a call from Kit, and Alex is in the hospital. Broken pelvis. So I'm going to Santa Fe. Tomorrow I'll go out and see what I can do to help them, Alex and Kit, because they're some of my closest friends and really I'd be a terrible person if I didn't go do what I can. <br /><br />So for all of you OKC people, that's where I'll be for the next couple days/possibly a week or two. Catch you all when I get back. there might/should be updates here as things go; I'll have plenty of time for blogging.
