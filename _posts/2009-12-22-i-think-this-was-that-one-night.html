Remember? The night that I drank far far too much? Excessive amounts of excess. So hungover in the morning I couldn't move? Yeah, well, there was this artshow, and I was broke, and a lot of other people fed me booze, but I wasn't really keeping track. I started counting in the morning, and the number of drinks I had was some where in excess of <span >way too many</span>. I think my short term memory shorted out there at the end, I have a lot of the same picture, like I took it and then forgot. Not that I remember now, but the photos at least tell something. Artifacts. Thank god for autofocus. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >I know, deadpan images are dead, but I liked the asshole tax.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Husband...<br/></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >and wife.<br/></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
