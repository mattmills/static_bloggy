Went to bartlesville again, two weeks ago? three? I'm thinking three. And when I go to bartlesville, there is some madness. In no particular order: A broken cell phone. Divorce. Drinking. driving. A puppy that I couldn't keep, for now. Inappropriate jokes at 9am that were funny for all by 9:05.

And then, a delicious, calm breakfast from Heather, and an nice tranquil couple hours sitting around shooting the shit. Then we drove home.
