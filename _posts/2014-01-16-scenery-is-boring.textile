Don't get me wrng, I love a good lanscape, but they're not alive, you know? OK, plants are alive. But add people, and it's actually looking back at you, or at least could be. My new years resolution: more pictures of people, less pictures of not people (arrived at some weeks late, but whatever).

So yeah: believe it or not, these are some of the less twisty parts of the road to Stinson from where I live. I'd need a wide angle lens and some serious time with the concept of curves to really get it in the frame, if you know what I mean. And that would be boring.
