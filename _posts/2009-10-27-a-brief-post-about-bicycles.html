just to frustrate the people waiting for KRONDOR pictures. Don't worry, I'm onto that next, I'm even skipping the openbeta stuff to get to it. But anyway: <br /><br />The Science Museum (their real name, no kidding) here in the city has a little exhibit on antique bicycles, or the development of the bike, or something like that. Really cool, I want two of everything they have on display. including that steam powered bike. that's pretty rad. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Lori looks at an original boneshaker.
