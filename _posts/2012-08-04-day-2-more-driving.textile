This was day 2 of driving. It really was a pretty spectacular day, shot through with beautiful vistas and interesting stops. I had a green chili breakfast burrito to start it off, and it was just smooth sailing from there until after Petrified forest NP. Since those photos are in the next post, I'll save that half of the day for later.
