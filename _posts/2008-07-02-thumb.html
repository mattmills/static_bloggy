first of all, my thumb is fine. I lost a chunk of skin, that's all. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/arts/design/24isla.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">This is hilarious.</a> <br /><br /><a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/galleries/split_second/">Barbra Probst</a> on her photos of the same subject, same instant, from many perspectives. Her comment about not caring about what's in the pictures so much as how they're taken is bullshit, and a good example of why you don't have to listen to what the artist says all the time. It's a cool idea, though, and the photos are really interesting, so go look.<br /><br />And as for my photography, I've finally realized what I need to do. I'm at a bit of a creative dead end, not knowing what to do for a while. So, I'm gonna bust with the white seamless (see <a href="http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=0&a=0&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=7&at=0">Richard Avedon</a>) to get the juices flowing again. I even have a model in mind, if she's free next weekend. now, to the shower.
