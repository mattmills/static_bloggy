<p>Well, one of them&#8230; there were several, actually, but this one is the only one I went to. And there are other good photos, mostly variations on these though. And Atlas (the baby, and isn&#8217;t that a awesome name?) was born the day before yesterday (or was it yesterday? I haven&#8217;t been able to keep track of the days in weeks). If the kid&#8217;s as rad as his parents, he&#8217;s set for a rad life.</p>
