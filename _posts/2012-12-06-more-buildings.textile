The title of this post is a lie; I just didn't know what to call it; they're not pictures of people, but I hate the word cityscapes. It is buildings, and a couple courtyards, and roses growing in an ancient Roman graveyard. A picture of a nice cloud thrown in, because I'm still me. 

Yeah, got another half dozen or so posts left in this vein, and then the vacation slideshow will be over, and the regular life slideshow will recommence.
