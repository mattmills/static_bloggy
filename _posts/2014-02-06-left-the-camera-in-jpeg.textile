So this was what, just before xmas? Severin came to town, and so we had to meet up for drinks. There was some confusion, followed by some stumbling, but luckily sophie was there to keep shit together. 

These would have been in color, but I somehow got the camera in JPEG mode, whichmeans these have a weird blurry look to them when zoomed all the way in, as if the details were painted. Oh well.

Which reminds me, I still haven't done any work on a RAW converter to use with DarkTable. The list of projects keeps growing, and the time to work on them is somewhere between not much and nil. I need to prioritize, I suppose. Maybe after the move.
