So, my blog hero (because everybody needs something to aspire to) posted about <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2008/04/if-children-are-to-learn-anything-about.htm">telling kids to be an artist</a>. I want to say, here and now, being an artist isn't all million dollar paintings and getting hot babes. Those are side effects, and not everybody gets 'em. Some of us are still broke our whole lives, just doing it because there isn't anything else we can do. <br /><br />It ain't easy being an artist. There are always haters. Critics. People who see something good and just want to tear it down. The hard part is knowing when they're right and you suck and when you gotta just shake 'em off, and the answer is, they're always wrong. You know your faults better than anyone, they don't know shit.<br /><br />Don't be an artist for the money. Don't do it for chicks, or for the image. Most artists don't have an image. The best ones are sort of humble and bashful when you try and tell them they're good. Don't be an artist because it gives you license. If you need a license, it isn't art. If you have to do it, if there's no way to stop whatever it is that comes out of you, that's art. You can't make art because you want to, you do it because you have to, because that little voice inside won't let you live and breathe and be at peace unless you're creating. You do it and do it and do it, and if you're lucky you know some people who get it, and if you're really really lucky some of those people will pay for it. <br /><br />Don't be an artist unless you have a fanatically strong stubborn streak. The real test isn't who's selling for millions at the Tate or the Met or Southeby's, but who sticks to their guns, never admits failure, even though they've gotta take a shit job at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_(novel)">Post Office</a> to cover the bills, they still do it, they turn that into their art. <br /><br />It's not good going crazy, having stupid sleeping disorders that make it impossible to  hold a regular job for more than 6 months, that make you want to run screaming into the night chasing after whoknowswhat. It's a special kind of madness, and it takes a huge wack of talent not to end up in the nuthouse walking that razorwire tightrope. <br /><br />And there's no net. Inevitably you fall. Sometimes you flap your arms on the way down and hope, and sometimes because you are that creative motherfucker, because you belong up there, flying, you grow those wings, and astound the world.  <br /><br />So, if you wanna be an artist, bust it out or go back to school and find a nice safe life. This isn't nice and it isn't safe and it isn't stable. Here there be sleepless nights and crazy manic 72 hour sessions in the studio and the only way you can keep it together is because there's no other way for you to be. <br /><br />On the other hand, artist chicks are hotter.
