description: "photos of camping from the RB67"
---

These are the _other_ photos from camping; at the last moment, packing, I decided to take my small boulder of a film camera, the Mamiya RB67. It's older than I am and weighs 20 lbs with the mirror prism. It's just on the edge of too heavy to handhold. It's also all those trite things people say about shooting with larger cameras: slow, contemplative. I found myself seeing pictures, and then grabbing the camera and shooting them.

I originally got this camera because I thought it would be a good platform to build a small scanning back. Then I thought I might as well shoot some film with it, to make sure it worked. As it turns out, you cock the shutter and wind the film with different levers, a thing that I still sometimes forget (which works out for me sometimes, see frame 1). I didn't even realize I missed the moment of looking at the exposed film, the magic of seeing all those pictures that I took, the ones that worked and the ones that didn't.
