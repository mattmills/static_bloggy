We got to the park, and we were all really super tired and cold. Since there were several photographers in the group, though, we had to go out and shoot, at least a little. The first two images I've already put out, shot hand-held at obscene ISO. the rest of these were shot on a tripod, at longer exposures (but still at ISO 6400 or so). I really wish it had been this clear in the daylight. Instead, it rained all day on us, and so most of my shots were equally gray.

Lesson learned: keep shooting when the light is good. Sleep when you're dead.
