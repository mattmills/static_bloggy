This is most of what we did the last weekend we went camping. It is at least as relaxing as it looks. Probably more so, because there were seveal hammocks for when floating became too strenuous. Beer, foods, the whole bit.

Astute observers will notice that there are actually two swimming holes depicted here, because we went to two different ones, on different days. My memory is a bit fuzzy, but I think it was a three day weekend? A needed break, anyway.
