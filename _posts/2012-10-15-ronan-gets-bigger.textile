So, some sunday in there, we went to visit KJ, and Ronan was being especially cute... in the way that only little babies can be. She's already crawling, for crying out loud, and trying to stand on her own. Seems like yesterday she was a newborn. I've extraplated, and at this rate she'll be 12ft tall and running half the world by the age of 12.
