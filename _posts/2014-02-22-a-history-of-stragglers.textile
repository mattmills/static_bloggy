So, we're in the middle of moving, and the only real computer I have access to is my server, the one that runs the web site you're reading. It's cloudy, which means when I move house, I don't have to move it. By real computer, I mean something that can run, at a minimum, vim and git. My rasberry pi also qualifies, but it's in a box somewhere. Those are the minimum tools I need to do a blog post. Luckily, I had photos already out on the server, or theis would be a very boring post indeed.

These are more from the period between Xmas and New Years. One from sonoma, and the others walking back from brunch at Portal. 

Not much to say right now. moving is hard, and it's going to take us all week, I'm afraid. Tomorrow is the furniture, but there are a million little things that are going to take us a while to get. The kitchen, the closets, the camping stuff, yada yada yada. Up and down stairs until I'm tired of it, and then a few more trips. This was my idea, really. Save a little money, get into a nicer area. I'll enjoy it once I get there, but now, I'm tired.
