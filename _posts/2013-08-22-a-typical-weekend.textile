So, about a week after I got back, we got together on the boat for something. It may have been Fallon's birthday. Anyway, there was some drinking, followed by some sleeping, and then a ride to Sacremento to meet Fallon's dad, where, for some reason, there was a person in a Bear suit that didn't want to pose for a photo. 

The second to last photo is something I've been experimenting with, calling them 'awkward compositions'. The idea is to take the natural composition, what I would instinctively do, and throw everything just a little off. So, instead of perfect thirds, you get half sky, half ground, and a line (the gaurdrail) going trough in the center. It's an attempt to break out of my habits, more or less, and still make good photos. 

It's hard to break habits that you've had for more than a decade; I've been a photographer longer than I've been anything else. I want to stay fresh, give myself challenges. I've been thinking of assignments beyond little composition exercises (which, after all, are just foreplay, practice for the main event). I don't know where I'm going with this, but I'm going somewhere.
