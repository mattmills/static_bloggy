I just don't feel like writing. Weird. During the day, I have ideas, but not really time to write them, so they don't get done.<br /><br />Everything keeps changing, again and again. It's so fast, it's hard to keep up, but at the same time, it all just flows and i roll with it. Some of the chaos is my creation, some of it is shit that happens, and some a combination.<br />
