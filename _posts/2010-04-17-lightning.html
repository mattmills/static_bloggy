I know I already posted this to twitter once, but a little backstory would be nice maybe. I&#8217;m always out in Midwest City on tuesdays, and I usually go home via surface streets, but I decided to take the highway to try and beat the storms. Of course, I ended up in the middle of it, and I had to try to take pictures of the lightning while driving down the road. And it worked.</p>
