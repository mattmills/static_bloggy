These were mostly last sunday, except the last one, which was saturday. A lovely evening hanging out on the roof deck with our neighbors from down the hall. The street picture, I just had to put up somewhere. The neighbors, though: one is a painter, and the other makes jewelry, of the fine art variety, in all different sorts of metals. Cool folks, both of them.
