Sunday was location scouting. And thrift stores. And a nondisclosure agreement, so I'm not sure what I can and can't say, but none of these are embargoed, formally or informally, so there you have it. We're working on cool shit, and when it comes out it's going to be really rad, but that's not for four months or so, so expect teasers and hints and nothing substantive until at least january.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Credit where credit is due: photo by Chelsea M'lynn.</span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
