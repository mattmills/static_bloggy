wow. I never knew. I figured this blog wouldn't make it to ten posts, much less fifty. And people are reading. Hi people. Here's photos:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0608-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0608-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>This is from last sunday when I should have been in bed. So is this:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0608-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0608-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>That's Adam's blood. On the concrete. It was more than a little hard to take this one, as I had to lean out over the edge of the bridge, and see what would happen if I fell.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0609-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0609-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Driving to work. Rain, and I'm the only one going my way.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0611-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0611-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0613-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0613-6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0614-7.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0614-7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>There's a certain contingent among photographers that there are some places you don't have to bother carrying your camera because there aren't any photos there.

Later.
