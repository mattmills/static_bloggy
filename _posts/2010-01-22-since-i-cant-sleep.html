I'm gonna post some photos. Two wednesdays ago, I found myself at hooters. No, really. Talk about the ass-end of the restaurant business... I'm told the girls that wait there at least make a lot of money. Good for them, now they just need to work on the food. (These girls, for those of you that don't know them, aren't hooters girls, just friends). Then I went to the new Blue Note. It was weird times 20. Times 10^100. Maybe not that weird; there were no green monsters or invading Persians. Not even any mild-mannered persians. But weird. And cleaner. Anyway, photos:<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rebounding/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rebounding/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rebounding/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rebounding/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rebounding/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
