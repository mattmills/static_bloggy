Yes, there was an internet cat video festival in Oakland, and yes, we had to go. By far the coolest thing showing there was this guy, doing live poem compositions on the subject of your choice; Sophie says "Cats in space!" and the guy pouns on his typewriter for about five minutes, talking and bantering with us. Appearently he's normally in the tourist areas of SF, Fisherman's Wharf and such.
