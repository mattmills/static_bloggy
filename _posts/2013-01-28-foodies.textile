Before you get the pitchforks, that's actually the name of the restaurant. A little Thai place on Hudson between 10th and 13th, in midtown. Really good food, decent beer prices. Small, diner atmosphere, a little eccentric, but overall enjoyable. Good company too, with Sophia and Anne and Isaac.

Also, despite the two food/restaurant posts in a row, I swear this isn't becoming a food blog. Anyway, photos:
