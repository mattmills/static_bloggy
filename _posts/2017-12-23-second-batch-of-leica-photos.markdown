Another 2 days, and 20 more photos. I gotta say, I love the lens on this camera. Summicron wide open is just a really nice look. The fine detail you get out of this system is just unbelievable. That said, highlights are still garbage and the meter is so bad; not just a little bad but super inconsistent. My guess is that they've biased it to underexpose to compensate for the highlight issue. My conclusion so far is that there's nothing I can't do with my Fuji by using it in aperture priority and shooting with lower ISOs.
