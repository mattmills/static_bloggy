Velvet monkey puts on an annual fashion show at their Plaza district location, and a couple people I know were modeling and since I'm friends with a few of the stylists, I went and did some behind the scenes shooting at the downtown location while they were getting ready. Some good concepts, some good looks, pretty fun overall. I've got another post coming where we did a little guerilla shoot in the street, those'll be up sometime tomorrow.
