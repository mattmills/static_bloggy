So, instead of boring you with stupid vapid details of my life that nobody cares about but me, and that I in all likelihood won't care about tomorrow, I'm going to write about photography. Methods, rules and techniques. These are old school "learn to use then learn to break" rules. My 1000 word photo one lesson will be in here. The stuff I was thinking about for<span > Methods of Photography</span> will be here. Meanderings, maybe. How I work, definitely.<br /><br />OK, rule 1: Always carry your camera. Other people should think you have codependency issues with that machine. It doesn't matter if your chosen instrument weighs one ounce or five pounds, it should always be with you. Other people will think you're crazy, and that's fine. Other people don't have to be on the que vive to do their work. They can note an idea and follow up on monday. We photographers are forever here and now.<br /><br />I carry 15 lbs of camera and lenses and batteries everywhere. I carry it so much I got home from the store yesterday, went out back to grill hot dogs, and I didn't even realize I still had the bag on until I tried to sit down.<br /><br />Speaking of bags, the bag you carry your shit in is also important, if you use one. It's gotta be bombproof, bulletproof, waterproof, and just a little bigger than you think. Quick access. Padding or no is up to you. I use unpadded bags because I hate the added bulk of padding and most of them are in either unfashionable or unfunctional shapes. There is more variety of good unpadded bags. Right now I use a crumpler. In the past, it's been a domke, but I saw the crumpler in REI and had to have it. It's only the third bag I've ever had that I really liked. I carry one body plus two lenses, sometimes three. No flash. Spare batteries. Pick the things you think you need, carry them around for a little while, get rid of them if you decide you don't use them enough to be worth the weight.<br /><br />Because sometimes, you just need your camera, and you'll never know when that's going to be. You're going to be tired, barely able to move, eyes closing involuntarily, and there, in front of you, will be the perfect pictures unfolding. What good is seeing as a photographer sees (in pictures, of course) if you haven't a camera to put it to use?
