New job means new commute means new things to see. This commute is a lot shorter, so there's only two blocks between work and the BART. I may pull a "Bruce Davidson":http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&ALID=2K7O3RJSJ42A&VBID=2K1HZSWEPT8V&PN=1 and shoot on the BART. Although, to be honest, my day to day isn't nearly that gritty. SF in the 2010s is nothing next to NY in the 80s if the photos are evidence of anything.
