I've felt really weird over the last week. I bonked my head, quit my job (for good this time), had totally wild nights and good days, and I feel wonderful for all of it.<br /><br />Quitting my job was probably the best thing I've done since I started the job. If you're not doing what you want to be doing with your life, fucking stop that shit. Do better things.<br /><br />There was this bonfire, lots of people, fire:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-1.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-2.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-3.jpg"  />And yes, I know this is a cliche. Oh well. Reagan and Lauren:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-4.jpg"  />Erin hit a nail right before getting to sauced friday:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-5.jpg"  />Curt (sorry if that's the wrong spelling), and I have no idea where he got that hat:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-6.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-7.jpg"  />Ash, new in town:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-8.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-9.jpg"  />And then with the wig and glasses, the random costumery this guy finds, I don't know:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-10.jpg"  /><br /><br />Then there was the cupping on saturday, a coffee tasting. It was interesting, although I have to say that whenever I'm on the sport to come up with words for taste, I draw a blank. It was cool though. Part of the random goodness of the week. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-11.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-12.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-13.jpg"  />
