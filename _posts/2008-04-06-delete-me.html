Like something out of a sci-fi novel, I came home and found myself already in my bed. What the hell?<br /><br />"Hey, what are you doing here?"<br /><br />Other me sat up in bed. "I'm here from the future. I need to tell you something very important."<br /><br />"What? ok, you're from the future. What kind of day will I have tommorow, so I know you're on the level?"<br /><br />"You'll wake up, go pick up lora for sodas, go have the meeting with only three editors, and then... well, that's what i'm here to-"<br /><br />And then he dissappeared. Yeah, this didn't really happen. I just didn't feel like putting up pictures right now, feeling lazy. have fun without me, internet.
