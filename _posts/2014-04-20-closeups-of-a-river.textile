I did these mostly because it was a grey, cold day in the valley. You can't predict the weather. so, I did what I'd always been taught to do: when the pictures aren't working, get closer. Simplify. Figure out what attracted you to what you're pointing the camera at in the first place, and move in towards that. Sometimes it works. Sometimes that means you have to do a little bouldering. Sometimes that means you're digging through layers to find something to wipe the mist off of your lens. Whatever works.
