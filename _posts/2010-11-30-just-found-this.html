<p>Just found this in my scratch buffer, and I don&#8217;t remember where I got it from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And how can man die better<br />
    Than facing fearful odds,<br />
    For the ashes of his fathers,<br />
    And the temples of his gods</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little googling gave back <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lays_of_Ancient_Rome/Horatius">Lays of Ancient Rome, Horatius</a>. It&#8217;s one of those battle poems that always leaves me teary. Which is to say one of two*. The other being <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070513072721/http://etext.virginia.edu/britpo/tennyson/TenChar.html">Charge of the Light Brigade</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cannon to right of them,<br />
    Cannon to left of them, <br />
    Cannon in front of them<br />
    Volley&#8217;d &amp; thunder&#8217;d</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The metal of the 19th century. Rock on.</p>
<p>*update: I remembered another one right after I hit publish, Henry V, act 4 scene 3. Of course.</p>
