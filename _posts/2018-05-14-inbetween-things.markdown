Did a bunch of film scans this evening, and I have to say I'm not super happy with what I'm getting from the 35mm work. I'm going to go through the motions of developing what I've already shot and looking at it honestly, but I'm not super positive about it. A lot of the things I like from the work coming out of the 6x9 camera just aren't there in the smaller format. Maybe the 40mm 1.4 will be the silver bullet to make it all magical again, but I'm not holding my breath.

In the meantime, here are three images off the queue. I don't think they're related at all, or even shot within a month of each other.
