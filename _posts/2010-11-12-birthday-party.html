<p>SO, I&#8217;m pretty sure this was timmy&#8217;s birthday or something&#8230; there was a keg, I remember that, and the european exchange students (not pictured). Also, while cody didn&#8217;t land the pictured trick, he got it on the next try. I just like this photo better.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I once again have a huge backlog of photos ready to blog about. I&#8217;m wishing my blogging software had better scheduling capabilities. I might have to hack on that sometime soon. Or maybe see if there&#8217;s an extension already written. That&#8217;d be cool. Now I have to code all afternoon, finish up with the old job stuff before I have to start the new job stuff on monday. <span class="caps">NEW</span> <span class="caps">JOB</span>, Yay! Anyway, photos:</p>
