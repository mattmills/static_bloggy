get it? OK? no? Well, anyway, this was actually a pretty fun night. there was food off a truck, and ice cream, and a record store that had materialized in the plaza district since my last visit. Oh yeah, and hanging out with one of my best firends in the world, KJ. There are a few people I miss since moving away, and she's pretty high up on the list.
