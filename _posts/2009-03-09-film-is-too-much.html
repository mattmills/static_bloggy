title: Film is too much

Shooting in a bit of a different mode yesterday. With the digital camera. Decided film was too expensive. So sue me. I don't think the look suffers that much. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I like how even the McD's sign is screwed up. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Every time I talk about this project, people bring up the tower theatre; looking at the fron of it, I wonder if it wouldn't be easier to just build a new one in the vacant lot across the street. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />The shooting yesterday wasn't as good, as fulfilling as is was the first couple outings; I thought, walking back, that I might just give up the project and move on. But it seems like I'm onto something; the dilapidation there is a symptom of the wider economic problems. I can't tell if it's getting worse or better. Also, I look at the pictures, see I'm doing good work, and can hardly stop myself.
