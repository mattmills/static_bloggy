The middle picture is actually Oakland, which doesn't super matter. Just thought you'd like to know.

Also: really good piece of fiction I just found out about even though it came out two years ago (via [Wendy Liu's blog](https://dellsystem.me/fragments)): [Uncanny Valley](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/).
