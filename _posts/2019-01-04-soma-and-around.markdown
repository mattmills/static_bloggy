The middle picture is actually Oakland, which doesn't super matter. Just thought you'd like to know.

Also: really good piece of fiction I just found out about even though it came out t̶w̶o̶ three years ago (via [Wendy Liu's blog](https://dellsystem.me/fragments)): [Uncanny Valley](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/). Also this burst of posing is partially inspired by Liu, although I'm not going to get 365 posts in this year, I'm going to try for 260; that's one every working day, more or less. I know I generate enough photos and have enough backlog that it's possible.
