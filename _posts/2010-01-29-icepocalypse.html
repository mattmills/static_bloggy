Yes, I'm annoyed by my own title.. but I do it because I know so many of you will also be frowning, and that makes me laugh. <br /><br />So I went for a walk, down to Grant's house to make coffee, and he had some interesting news which I'm not sure I can share yet, not the big Ruby news, but something else really cool for him personally. All I can say is damn. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Just another wanderer. "I'll be all right, as long as I have some traction," he told me.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was rush hour, on 23rd street... never seen it this dead at that hour. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And yeah, there was all this white stuff on the ground. god's cocaine party. Mostly sleet, though, not the fine white powder all kids and skiers love. Blowing wind, sleet in my face, and there I was, taking pictures. It's a 15 minute walk that took me about 20 due to detours.  <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >I do love these lights.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Good coffee at Grant's, Then I walked to dinner at Mcnellie's.  I kept drinking after dinner, getting drunk and thinking about hard math problems in my head. I always know I've had a long day at the computer when I'm thinking about math, drunk. (was it three or four pints? I was only there an hour and a half, must have been three). Yeah, Snow and Ice and everything nice. I'm going back to bed. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
