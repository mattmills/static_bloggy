My shoulder is killing me... no idea why, I'm hoping I just slept on it wrong. The photos: I was down in norman for NMF thursday, friday, and saturday; this was the first night, everybody trying on Kj's new glasses. Also Joey at the bottom rockin' out with one of the bands he plays in that isn't Shitty/Awesome.
