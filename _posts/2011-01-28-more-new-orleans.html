<p>between things, so a quick blog post&#8230; charging my phone, actually. Toured the Abita brewery while I was in Louisiana&#8230; that&#8217;s the crowd in the first photo. That&#8217;s Lane(y?) and Jeana sorta dancing at rock n&#8217; bowl in the second&#8230; and finishing off the night at some local bar in the third. I like that bars there don&#8217;t close except when the bartender feels like it. It lets the night flow much more naturally. Speaking of bars, my phone is charged enough to get me through the night and I&#8217;m off.</p>
