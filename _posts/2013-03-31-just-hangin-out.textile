This was several houses ago, and it seems like a couple lifetimes as well. A lot of things that were planned hadn't happened yet, and a lot of the plans hadn't even been fully formed. Sometimes you end up back at the house with a bottle of vodka and a bunch of 5 hour energy and you make the best of it. (Note: those shots were awful, don't bother).
