Because I don't want to go on _ad nauseum_ about the meetup, I'm just gonna lump together things in two more posts. The people and the scenes- if I'd been doing this chronologically as I went, it wouldn't be so bad, but now after the end it's time to post and move on. 

So, they took us bowling wednesday, and it was pretty fun, despite the fact that I got the lowest score both times (bowling is not my sport). There was some fairly memorable sushi thursday, as well- 18 of us packed in to a restaurant smaller than my home office, with seating for 16.
