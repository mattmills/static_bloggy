My friends Heather and Kyle got married, oh a month and a half ago now, and I was lucky enough to attend... really beautiful ceremony, in the alley where they had their first beers together. While some of my longtime friends know that I refuse, under any circumstances, to be a wedding photographer, I didn't take any money for this one, and I would have been there anyway, so in this case I made an exception and took some photos. Besides, they're really amazing people and I wanted to do something nice for them.
