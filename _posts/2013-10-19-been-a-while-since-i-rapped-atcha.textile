This is "@photomattmills":http://twitter.com/photomattmills, back on the air. The extened hiatus owes to my lack of a personal computer these past two months. I changed jobs, and the new employer has clauses in the contract about who owns what I produce on company equipment... anyway, I needed my own rig. I've completely forgotten where I was in the flow of editing and producing blog posts, so excuse me if I repeat myself.

The new gig is super sweet. I'm learning a crap ton, which is great, and my co-workers and bosses are all pretty chill.
