Yes, Virginia, there really is a reason the 36x24mm rectangle is magic. It is a simple as three words- depth of field.<br /><br />Human vision is funny, in that there are a lot of things that never get noticed. Unless someone has a problem doing it, they never really notice your eyes focusing, for example. The truth is that they're focusing all the time. Another thing they never notice: when focused on one thing, everything else is blurry. This is partly because your eyes have the highest concentration of cells at the center, and also because of depth of field (DoF for short). <br /><br />DoF is a natural effect of lenses. If a certain plain is focused, then everything around (in front of and behind) it is blurry. The focal length of the lens has a lot to do with how blurry. That is, the shorter the focal length, the less blur there is, and the more depth of field there is, regardless of aperture.
