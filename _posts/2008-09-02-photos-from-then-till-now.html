So I finally downloaded the card that's been in my camera for two weeks. Andrew, and if you look closely, you can see yr. humble photographer:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0001.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0001.jpg"  /></a><br />Sunset, at more or less the same time:<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0002.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0002.jpg"  /></a><br />Anne and Kit, in the mountains. These two together (or separately) are just really awesome, good company and good friends.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0003.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0003.jpg"  /></a><br /><br />Clines Corners tourist trap, where I had an early lunch.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0004.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0004.jpg"  /></a><br />And I'm still doggedly taking my camera to the supermarket. Yes, there are still more pictures to be had there.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0005.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0005.jpg"  /></a><br />And this is my current project: updating my portfolio. Hopefully by the end of the week I'll have shopped it around and have real work as a photojournalist.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0006.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0006.jpg"  /></a>
