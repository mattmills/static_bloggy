Two days ago now, I decided to go for a long walk down the beach. Adam, my friend that grew up here, said that the beach was contiguous, that you could walk the whole way to West Bay (not to be confused with west end, where we're staying).

So, having decided against scuba instruction, I figured the walk would be a good afternoon's entertainment. I could get a feel for the island and see what there was to see. I also managed to get mild heat exhaustion and a slight sunburn. Lesson learned (for probably the fifth time): when you go for a walk in the tropics, wear sunscreen and take a bottle of water. 

From where we're staying, it's about a 10 minute walk to the end of half moon bay (no relation to the one in cali). There's a point where the paved road stops, and the beach is the only way forward. I walked about 2/3rds of the way to the far tip of the island, and turned back because I didn't have any water and I was tired. After all, this is a vacation, not a death march. 

A note about the photos: I'm getting a little more used to the phone-only workflow. It's still clunky, just because switching between apps is not as fast as it is on the desktop, and because I use 4 different apps to get them ready to upload (currently: camera+, ps mobile, photos, and flickr). Hopefully I've sorted the ordering; editing this way, over ssh, I have to publish the post before I can see.
