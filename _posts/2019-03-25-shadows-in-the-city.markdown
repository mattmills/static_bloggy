I think I may have a weird mental block around the Leica. I did a little shooting this weekend with the Fuji again, and it was a lot easier to work with. I think actually the thing that made it easier is autofocus. Call me lazy, but I think it's actually faster than I can focus. When I was younger, I could almost always beat the AF, but maybe I've lost a step, or the talent has atrophied. Either way, here I am. People move around a lot, and also they are often closer than 2.5 feet from the camera, and I noticed that too. I took three lenses and only used one, the 35mm 'Fujicron,' which is a 50mm full frame equivalent (roughly ~52.5mmE, but who's counting?). It's an excellent lens.

I've been watching this youtuber [Thomas Heaton](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfhW84xfA6gEc4hDK90rR1Q) and in particular [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRp4sDBX88A) (although I've been watching since he was reviewing a camera I was curious about) where he talks at length about going down a wrong path with his channel and his photography, obsessing over gear and chasing likes and not really just focusing on making good images. It's a good lesson, and something I myself am continually re-learning. I think some people can obsess about this stuff, but it's not something that's healthy for me.

So here we are. These, incidentally, were taken with the Leica, not that it matters.
