<p>Compared to andy other time of the day, the streets in Cairo are empty in the morning, about 6am. I say about because I&#8217;m not entirely sure of when this was. There&#8217;s been some confusion about daylight savings time. I&#8217;ve spent today in front of the computer, except for the half hour walk I took this morning, in the quiet. Programming and thinking and playing games. Man I need to get outta this room. Maybe go walk around. Down to the Museum, even though it&#8217;s closed.</p>
