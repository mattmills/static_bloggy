I'm going to spend at least some of today outside in the sunshine. It's a good day for it. I spent all day yesterday sitting inside on my ass. I was reading, which is good, but I really wish I'd gotten out a little, so now, here I go. Before I head out, random picture:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog430-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog430-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
