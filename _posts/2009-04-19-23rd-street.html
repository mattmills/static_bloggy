So I finally got out and shot some yesterday, for the first time in three or four days. I don't know what exactly caused the slump; I've been doing a lot around the house, just sort of hanging out with friends, nothing terribly interesting. So I decided to do something with myself. Calling around to find someone to model failed, everyrone was either recovering from the weekend or not answering their phones.<br /><br />Anyway, no pretty ladies in these pictures. I had the crazy idea to go way out on 23rd street yesterday, and along the way I was sort of pulled in by all the signs I saw. I'm going to have to go back and shoot some more out there; might do a photo-walk of the few miles between choctaw and post road. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >This victorian house was out in the middle of a lot of mobile homes for sale; it looked more like a storage for unwanted uprooted homes than a sales lot.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >I shot this mostly for the patch of light and the clouds.
