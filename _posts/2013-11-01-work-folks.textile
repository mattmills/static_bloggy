I've been a bad friend. I haven't talked to a bunch of these folks in a while, not directly. I'm have to fix that after this weekend. I'm just so damn busy and run down. But there are Lunches (when all of these photos were taken) and there will be more of them. Sometimes it takes seeing things to remember how important some people are.
