They seem to just keep cropping up. I'm up to my eyes in weird shit lately. First there was my case of the weirds last thursday (or was it friday? I'm too lazy to check), then there was the apprenticeship contest saturday, then there was a beauty pageant saturday night, and now Lora's not answering texts, even though we were supposed to have an editors meeting. Strange but true.<br /><br />First, the apprenticeship contest. My dad asked me Friday morning if I wanted to go and photograph, ,and I said of course. I got up at 4am,  after about 5 hours of sleep,  and went to teh union school, where the contest was to be held. 90% of the guys that even bothered to be in the competition wee idiots. Every time I walked into the plumbing room, where all tha various plumbing tasks were happening, I got looks from about half the guys, like they didn't want me to be there. Oh well, I got my pictures.<br /><br />I hope Mike likes 'em, though he told my dad in no unncertain terms that I was in the program. Just as I find out I have the opportunity to do photography (boring, mind-numbing photography, though), I have a sure job doing something else, something interesting. Hard work, sure, but there isn't a job in the world worth doing that isn't difficult in some way.<br /><br />So there's that, and then there was this pageant. Mom's friend Georgie from work had her daughter  in the Miss Hispanic UCO pageant, and she won. And since mom didn't want to go alone, and I think wild horses couldn't have dragged dad out to something like that, I went.<br /><br />The organization of the program was shit, the MC was laughably bad, stuck to the script to thte detriment of the show, etc, etc. On the plus side, there were three very attractive ladies posing in also attractive outfits (including swimsuits), dancing four our entertainment, etc. Which made it a worthwhile outing. Now I've been at two major events in this girl's life, her quincinera, and now this pageant. Georgie had me come and photograph at the quincinera about four years ago.<br /><br />And from there I went home and to bed. Weird dreams that I can't remember. I made brunch. eggs and bacon and home fries.<br /><br />Grocery store with mom, dinner, out for coffee. Still reading don q, and it gets better as it goes. That's all Ive got for now. pics to follow when I feel like it later.
