<p>let&#8217;s see&#8230; it&#8217;s been a few weeks since I&#8217;ve done this, had a new job to adjust to and some mad winter darkness blues to deal with&#8230; but here I am. Still looking for perfection. Still taking those photos. Still makin&#8217; your women wish they were my woman. Don&#8217;t get jealous&#8230; it&#8217;s just the photos. don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s more where this came from.</p>
