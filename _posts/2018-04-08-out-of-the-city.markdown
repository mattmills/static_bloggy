Pictures while a passenger in the car. This night there was a lot of traffic for some reason. Took us almost an hour just to get out of town, in one of those weird later-at-night traffic jams that happen sometimes for seemingly no reason on a thursday. 

I've definitely taken this first picture before; the astute among my readers may note that the car is pointed in the opposite direction, and, in fact, we weren't leaving the city then, so this post title is a lie. "into and out of the city" just didn't sound as good.
