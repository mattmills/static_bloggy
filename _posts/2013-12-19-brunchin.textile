been a while since I rapped at ya. I had a creative block that needed to be removed; blasted through, if nothing else. In the end, I decided the photos I was worrying over wenen't even that great, so I just cut them and moved on. Somtimes, it's startling to realize that even though I've been doing photography seriously for 15 years, I still don't know what I'm doing.
