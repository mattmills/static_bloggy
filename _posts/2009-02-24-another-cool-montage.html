Warning: this thing does contain some explicit images, so if boobs offend you, f off until you grow up, ok? On with the show:<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-dYnKUyoyg8&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-dYnKUyoyg8&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Found via <a href="http://www.1854.eu/">1854</a>, the blog of the British journal of photography. Appearently somebody is trying to get this banned or unbanned at a festival across the pond. That story is <a href="http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=840363">here</a>. Cool work, anyway.
