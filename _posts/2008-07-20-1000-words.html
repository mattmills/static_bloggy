Everything you need to know about shooting pictures in 1000 words:<br /><br />First, we're talking from a purely technical standpoint. What does what and a little of why. This is the iambic pentameter to sonnets we all hope our photographs will be. A photograph is an image formed by the action of photons on a sensitive medium. The light is usually focused by a lens, or concentrated by a pinhole, to form a coherent image of the world in front of the camera. <br /><br />The three things you have control over are focus, exposure, and where to point the camera. We are only dealing with the first two, thank the gods. The third is enough to talk about for centuries. Focus and exposure are controlled by four interrelated settings or choices: ISO (sensitivity of your medium), Shutter speed, aperture, and focus distance. In the old days, you chose an ISO and film like you chose a religion, but now there's a lot of room for play because everything can be changed on a whim.<br />ds<br /><br />About exposure: Too much light makes the picture all white. Too little light and the picture goes black. There is an amount of light that is just right for the scene you're trying to take a picture of, and this is called the correct exposure. The light and dark of a picture can be largely creative, but a new photographer should get a feel for correct exposure before doing anything crazy. Most any camera these days has a pretty good meter built in, but the right exposure isn't always what your meter tells you. Sometimes it's brighter, sometimes it's darker. Meters try to get a scene to hit in the middle of their tonal range. A scene with a lot of white, or bright things in it, will come out too dark. A scene with a lot of dark shadows or blacks will come out too light. Middle gray is boring. We need more than that. <br /><br />Enter the three factors that you can use to affect exposure. They are all measured in f-stops, which is a logarithmic scale which halves or doubles the light for each step. If you go up one stop on the shutter speed and down one stop on the aperture, the amount of light stays the same. Some people will quibble over halfs and thirds of stops, these people are the enemy and should not be invited for dinner. <br /><br />The scale (in full stop increments) of shutter speeds is 1/8000, 1/4000, 1/2000, 1/1000, 1/500, 1/250, 1/125, 1/60, 1/30, 1/15, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, etc. Those are fractions of a second. That's how much time you have. The 1/ is left off on most cameras for brevity and simplicity. Speeds of less than 1/30 are likely to result in blurry pictures because of camera shake. The more time you give to the exposure, the more light gets in. <br />
