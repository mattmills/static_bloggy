Another three photos. I just spent the better part of half an hour trying to salvage a pano of a beautiful Jaguar I saw in Berkeley, an XK 140 of unknown but probably 1950s vintage. After spending all that time on it (playing with software is wonderfully soothing if not productive), I took a mental step back, looked at it, realized it wasn't really saying anything worthwhile, just a shiny thing parked on the curb, and so I axed it. You're welcome.
