This was several weeks ago now, but I was in austin for a few days for Railsconf 2012. It was pretty fun, even though I didn't go to any talks really. My job, while I was there, was to answer questions people had about our product in our booth. Pretty cool to meet everyone, actually. 

Note that these photos are a bit out of sequence; my little camera had the wrong year. Next: NMF!
