So it's been... three whole days? and here I am with my second blog post with photos I've shot in the last 48 hours. That should tell you all you need to know about how I feel about the new rig, but here, an analogy, because why the hell not:

Have you ever ridden a bike? And you've been going for a while, but you're not tired yet, and for a moment the wind gusts at your back or the terrain levels out, and you and the bike just meld together and it doesn't really feel like there's any separation between what you want to do and where the bike goes? Just a sort of joy in the moment? It's like that.

So even though these aren't perfect, my hit rate is way up and the way I feel about shooting with the Leica: yeah, it's like that. Click click click. Some of these have been on instagram, but cropped, which is against my religion, so here they are as they're meant to be seen. I know this is a lot of street shots, but that's where I'm at right now. Should have some good times with people I know better and can maybe make some real portraits over the weekend. Now, to work on my odd salon talk.
