So this was only two weeks ago, pretty far down from my typical 2-6 months to get something posted (if you haven't seen some pictures you were expecting from me from before, say, a month ago, they're not happening here; reach out and I might be able to do something). I don't know why, but I found these really hard to edit. The color in the location is hard, and I threw my hands up on that and went black and white. But I'm also emotionally invested in this event, I suppose, and I want to do a good job. 

To that end, I took my hardest-to-use lens, and pitted it against really difficult conditions. It's a 500mm mirror lens, f/6.3. I was shooting hand held, and it's a manual focus lens. The focal plane (that is, how much depth of acceptable focus you get) is about 4", and there's about a 1/4" difference on the focus ring between 30 and 50 feet. So, about 12 thou, or 1/80th of an inch. I did ok; remember, you're seeing the good stuff, not the outtakes (there were many). Even so, using that lens forced me to use a very high ISO, which, if I'd been using a lower one, the color may have been more manageable... anyway. 

The salon was about abandoned things, from children, given up to an orphanage, to a whole island, in NYC, abandoned to nature. Stops include Paris and Angkor, with way stations at Sati (not a place, but an abandoned funeral practice), and Kepler's best idea that turned out to not be true. At least two of these pictures I only barely got, because I was too busy paying attention to the talk being given at the time. 

If you're interested in Odd Salon, the [Something Weird](https://www.facebook.com/groups/somethingweird) facebook group has more info on salons, past and future, as well as links to many of the talks that have been recorded.
