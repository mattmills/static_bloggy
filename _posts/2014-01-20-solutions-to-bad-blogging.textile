MAn, I just don't know about that last post. I mean, a couple sentences, some photos, that's prety typical. It's sort of weak sauce commentary though, is't it? I mean, I'm all for punk rock disregaurding of the rules, but photos of ships and the bay bridges are not punk rock. 

They say the solution to bad speech is more speech (I'm already quoting Cory Doctorow, you know how this week is going to go). So, it follows the solution to bad blogging isn't to delete the post, but to do it again, better.
