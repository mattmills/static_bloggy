So yeah, day of, I get to the fest, anticipating one hell of a day, and instead I get an unmitigated disaster. My camera broke and a bunch of other things happened. And then I heard about some other shit, fights and bullshit. And a pretty girl that I'm into left town for L.A. (Sidenote: I really should cut back on the women, but what fun would that be?). On the plus side, I was sober when it was time to drive back to the city. So I came back and passed out.
