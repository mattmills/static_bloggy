Orphans: Brawlers, bawlers and bastards. It's a mix of amazing things that blow my mind and amazing things that creep up behind me and hit me over the head and totally unbelievable things that really can't be said but can only be heard. Really, if you're too poor to afford this album, go steal it. It's easy enough, and totally worth going to jail over. <br /><br />On the good news front, I've got everything I need for work on tuesday. Laundry is washing, to get me ready for a flight tomorrow. I'm going to Denver for some tests to get into a study. The upshot is I get free blood pressure meds, free monitoring of a kidney problem I've got, and a free plane ride every so often. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_kidney_disease">Polysystic Kidney Disease</a> (adpkd) is what I've got. In my family the onset is a little earlier than average. My aunt had renal failure at 48, my uncle in his early forties, my grandmother at 46 or so (I don't know exactly because she wasn't born yet). My mom, and this is the good news, is 51 and is six months to a year from going on dialysis (they usually start dialysis before total kidney failure, at 15-20%). <br /><br />I've known about this since I was about 16. I was having headaches, went to the doc, he diagnosed me with high blood pressure and because of my history ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis. So, I know that in about 27 years I'm going to get really stuck and tied-down (in dialysis) if not just plain dead. <br /><br />It's OK. I have a plan, and yes, I know how it ends, six feet under. It's what happens between now and then that makes a difference. I've just gotta burn hotter, faster, and better than the rest, that's all.<br /><br />Let's see, I've been emailing with Lora over the past few days. I was pissed, and I let her know about it. I've gotten over being pissed, and we're finally talking, which is an improvement. <br /><br />New  <a href="http://www.adorama.com/ICAS5.html">camera</a> hotness, just for my job. It'll do. Anyway, more pictures later, when I'm done looking at today's take.<br /><br />Tom Waits is now God, replacing Virginia Woolf.
