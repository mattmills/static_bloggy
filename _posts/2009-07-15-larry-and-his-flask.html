This band, Larry and his flask, is a crazy high energy bluegrass punk band. Good sound, but I didn't stay for the second set. I don't know, the blugrass part of their sound got annoying to me, but then I loved them for the first half. Go figure. <br /><br />The guy with the base, though, I swear he was playing tourette's or something, different instruments every song, running around, throwing his base on the floor and then on a table, just crazy. Entertaining as hell. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, new camera's here, I'm playing with and and enjoying the hell out of it. Laters.
