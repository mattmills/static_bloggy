_Blogger's note: I wrote this_ yesterday _morning, and then got distracted looking for a link, and then work really got going. So, A double good morning to you._

My internet (and occasional real-world) friend [Robin Sloan](https://robinsloan.com) has this thing he calls the 'good morning' tweet, specifically a picture of breakfast or coffee or whatever. I'm never content with just one photo, of course, so here's a good-morning photo essay. I was lucky that it was foggy this morning.

I've been thinking about the events of last week (indeed, continuing events) and what the hell to do. There's a fight ahead, to be sure. This is a good start: [rules for survival](http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/11/10/trump-election-autocracy-rules-for-survival/). There were some other guides, things to read, like Solnit's [_Hope in the dark_](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/791-hope-in-the-dark?discount_code=FREEHOPEINTHEDARK). I can't seem to find the link that led me to that book, but it's out there. Also: [Eternal Fascism:
Fourteen Ways of Looking at a Blackshirt](http://interglacial.com/pub/text/Umberto_Eco_-_Eternal_Fascism.html) is worth a re-read at this point. Or a first read, if you're new.
