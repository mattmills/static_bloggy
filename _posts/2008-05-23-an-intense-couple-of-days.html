good times though. I like my new job. Lots of driving. Lots of seeing different places.  I shot more pictures in a week than I did in the six months before. unfortunately, they're all terribly boring, but fortunately, it pays well. Or will. First payday isn't  until the first. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0521-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0521-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />There were some tings I was going to say, but because of sleep deprivation, I've forgotten them. Oh yeah, that's what I wanted to talk about. Seriously, a 16 hour day followed by a 20-hour day with four hours sleep in between isn't for the amateurs. I'm afraid I haven't been terribly coherent or socially acceptable, but hey, who needs that at work? <br /><br />Seriously though, if anybody who's seen me in the last couple days stumbles on this, I'm really all right most of the time, but my short term memory goes to shit when I don't sleep. And since what little social grace I have doesn't come naturally, the mental energy I normally use to interact goes more toward remaining upright and breathing and such. For some reason, I can do photography until I pass out. And have.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />With this post, this blog is officially longer than my old one, payingoffmyloans. And while I had that blog, I didn't pay on my loans at all. I thought about finances a lot, mostly because I was always broke, and the conclusion I came to was that I needed more income. <br /><br />Also, for the first time met someone in the real world who'd read this before I knew them. I have a link in my email sig to the main site, and he saw this. And there was a weird moment when I thought, what did I put up there that I wouldn't want him to see, and I really couldn't think of a thing. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Life is good. Peace.
