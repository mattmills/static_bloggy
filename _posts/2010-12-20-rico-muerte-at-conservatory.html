<p>it just occurred to me what an odd name that was for a rock and roll venue&#8230; rock has never really been about conserving anything&#8230; and I&#8217;m in love with ellipses. Anyway, before rico muerte, there was this &#8220;dad metal&#8221; band who&#8217;s name I can&#8217;t remember, but who was unintentionally hilarious, all but the dude in the moon boot, who earned mad cred just for showing un in that shit. And the graffiti out back really kinda blew my mind. Anyway, onward and upward&#8230;</p>
