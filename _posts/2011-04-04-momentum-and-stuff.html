<p>The dude in the hat! Amazing. I wrote about momentum for the <a href="http://nakedeartharts.com/naked-talk">naked earth blog</a> but I have no idea when it will go live; sort of depends on the editor. The chair, I wanted to sit in it, I wanted to steal it and put it out by the curb; that chair did not belong in that show. Inconsistent curation. Also I&#8217;m supposed to write about graffiti for the NE journal. HA!</p>
<p>Anyway the last two images: Haley in her natural habitat hiding behind her phone, and Dillon, showing up briefly, only to disappear again. Also his natural habitat: late at night and sketchy as hell.</p>
