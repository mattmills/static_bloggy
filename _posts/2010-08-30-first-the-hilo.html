<p>Ah, what would life be without the Hilo, with its drag shows, strong drinks, and occasional free darts? More dignified? Less blurry? Who knows. I&#8217;ve definitely had some memorable nights there, and some nights I&#8217;d rather forget.</p>
<p>A bloggery aside: I&#8217;ve got this post, one more about the blue note, and then it&#8217;s all travel blogging for the next five weeks. Fun and adventure and really wild things. Also very few drunk people. Muslim country and all.</p>
