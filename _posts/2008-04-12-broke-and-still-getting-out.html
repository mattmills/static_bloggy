It's good to have friends. It's even better to have friends that are close enough that they don't give a shit that you're broke, they want you to come out anyway. "You broke? It'sa no problem!" (in my best italian accent). <br /><br />Thursday, I woke up and cleaned the kitchen. Then Dillon called, and he was working on his house. Bro is 23, has two houses, has the second hottest girl of anyone I know, doing well for himself. Anyway, he was wondering if maybe I wanted to come over and see the place, and I said, sure. <br /><br />The house is in a depreciated area; not the ghetto, but just a couple blocks north of it. Hardwood floors, rather small really. Nice workshop out back. He was taping off everything in the house that wasn't getting painted, and me being me, I picked up a roll of tape and helped. <br /><br />After about 6 hours of that, we went to this bar over on the north side of town, and damned if I can remember the name. 63rd and may, well, north of 63rd about a hundred yards. The waitress was nice but royally screwed the tabs, and for some reason I couldn't make a shot to save my life. This is different from my normal pool playing, where I can hold my own. <br /><br />From there, when the bar closed, there was the required beer stop and then a very fast drive to an apartment where two of the guys that were with us at the bar lived. For some reason a lot of these kids drive souped up cars. Anyway, one of the guys is a chef, and he produced a morel mushroom, which I had to try. When a chef at a five star tells you something is the best, it's a rule, you've gotta try it. (I once wrote a long essay about trusting good cooks, even if it isn't something you normally are into. I normally don't like mushrooms, for example). And, it was suprisingly good. A little grit, which he ascribed to a brief soaking (5 hours instead of 8). And the he brought out the steak. This delicious, amazing steak, super tender. Nrmally part of the ribeye, he said, and he sells them for $75 bucks a pop at his restaurant. As h'ors d'oeuvre with friends playing video games. Fucking awesome. <br /><br />Oh yeah, what was everyone doing while noshing on that deliciousness? Playing Rock Band, a game that takes conspicuous consumption to a whole new level, and is really fun looking in the process. They played the game, I took pictures. It worked out. Next time on Five Years: Pictures, and what I did with my friday...
