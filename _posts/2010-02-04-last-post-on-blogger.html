Well, this is the 371st post, and probably the last here on blogger. It's been a good run; with this and other blogs, I've been using blogger for going on five years (ha ha), but now they're stopping ftp uploading, and while I understand that, it's something I need, or at least that I really want. for the time being, I'll be posting at <a href="http://photomattmills.tumblr.com">photomattmills.tumblr.com</a>, and in the long term I'll be trying to extract the posts from this blog and put up something here that is more or less a redesigned and better Five Years. We'll see.
