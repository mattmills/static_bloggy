<p>This was the last show I saw, because at this point I could barely walk. Like, man I was tired. I drove home and I don&#8217;t even know how I made it. So tired. These are all with the 500, but none of the exposures were particularly long, a good thing in a jostling crowd mere feet form the mosh pit.
