I've seen several criticisms in the art blogs of tilted frames lately; that they're gimmicky, that it's been done, yadda, yadda. The truth is that as long as photography retains its performative aspect, that is, you have to choose moments while you're actually in them, things will always be a little off kilter. (There's a lot more to be said about the curation of robotic photography, but it'll have to wait; I'm tired, and this post is about the world  being a little sideways).
