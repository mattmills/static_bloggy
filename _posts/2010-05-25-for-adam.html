<p>I already posted these to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1440875@N23/" target="_blank">flickr group</a>, but here they are again. For those of you that didn&#8217;t know him, Adam was a really amazing guy. Nice, dependable, humble, an all around good guy, even after all he&#8217;d been through. He&#8217;s already missed. <br/><br/><span class="caption" >Elder Hellkat.</span><br/><img  src="http://www.photomattmills.com/images/adam/0001.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photomattmills.com/images/adam/0002.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><br/>

There&#8217;s a memorial bike ride for him starting at Sauced, 1pm on Friday; the car procession will follow the bikes, so anybody in cars who wants to join should be there. Memorial Services are at 2pm at Frontline church, 6th and broadway. The reception is afterwards at the prohibition room, in the gold dome, 23rd and western.</p>
