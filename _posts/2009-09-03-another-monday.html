Monday rolls around and I'm looking for polaroid film when who should call me but <a href="http://www.furburger.org">Christa May</a>, wondering if I'm down for a little libation at Mcnellie's. Of course I am. I'm always down for Mcnellie's.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Logan and Matt, not me, but Christa's new dude. Isn't it nice how everyone seems to be forming couples at the same time? Or at least several of my friends have over the past few weeks.</span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Matt by himself. </span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I'm posting all three of these because I can't remember which she liked and I think they all look pretty decent. #3 is the best, but who am I to judge? Oh yeah, that's my job. So yeah, just ignore the first two, those are just for Christa. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
