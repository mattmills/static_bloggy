There's a post about momentum coming, but to tide everyone over until I can get that together, here's some photos from earlier in the week. Francois, on wednesday: <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Ray-guns, at McNellie's:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Cody at blue note:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />It was one of those nights where I was the drunk one. Not as drunk as some people, though, and that turned out to be a good thing. I told Sarah early on in the night that I'd make sure she got home alright. She did, and I crashed on her couch.  My good deed for the week done, I give you the morning after:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />More in a few minutes, when I get the real momentum post together.
