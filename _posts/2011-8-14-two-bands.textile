the title of this post could have easily been 'too good bands'. This was "Dr. Pants":http://www.doctorpants.com and "Student Film":http://www.myspace.com/studentfilm , which I saw last week at the blue note and the mustache bash, respectively. Fun acts.

I wish I had more to say, but I'm getting ready to go to mexico (!!!!) and my head is full logistics and flight details and all the things I need to do... Yeah. Just a couple days to relax and not think about anything. I was thinking about not even taking a laptop. Now, if you're in either of those bands, pretend this whole paragraph was me saying nice things about you; I had at least that much to say all in my head earlier, but got distracted. Yeah.
