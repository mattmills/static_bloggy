<p>The last one is my favorite; something about these guys just indicates a degree of whimsy. Thanks to the old man for the use of his antiques and mirror, thanks to Heather for inviting me and introducing all of us, and thanks to Kyle for the sweet suite (didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d pass that pun up, did you?). There&#8217;s one more b-ville post coming, the road home, which is always sweet, and you shouldn&#8217;t miss, &#8216;cause it&#8217;s got more KJ in it. Probably tomorrow lunch or in the evening, depending on how the day goes.</p>
