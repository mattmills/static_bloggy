title: people come back to town for a holiday

Somebody this weekend asked me this weekend, in a pointed, trying-to-give-advice kind of way, why I hang out with the people I do... as if there are better people somewhere. The truth is it's damn hard to find people I can talk to, I need all the friends I can get. Real people, people who don't fuck with trivialities. They sure as hell have their faults, but so do I. <br /><br />Speaking of friends, of real people... a bunch of people came back into town last week for the holiday, all of whom I was glad to see. This is mostly about them, and the next few posts, too... it's been a good break. Now back to the grind. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Rayguns and Devin.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/txgiving/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/txgiving/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Caitlin, in from Austin fo a day, then gone the next.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/txgiving/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >I flew a kite that day, and it was fun even though the wind was weak sauce.
