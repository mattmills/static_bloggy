<p>Yeah, workin on thanksgiving morning&#8230; postin photos for your ass in my cold apartment&#8230; the window leaks around the window A/C&#8230; gotta fix that soon. These were the week before halloween, which means I more or less a month behind on posting shit&#8230; oh well. You can&#8217;t rush art. and By Art, I mean, I&#8217;m a slacker. Another post later today, so check back here instead of watching football after the feast.</p>
