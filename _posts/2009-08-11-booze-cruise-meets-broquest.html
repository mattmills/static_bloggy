title: Booze Cruise Meets BROQUEST
date: 2009-08-11

Or at least one of the members of BROQUEST was there. All in all, a fun night. I keep hearing that other people are doing booze cruise on saturdays now, if that's true could someone tell me? Chris? I just want to drink and ride bikes with people, and who cares what night it's on, right? <br /><br />Anyway, between last week's illness, starting the new job, and all the things I was doing over the weekend, I've been neglecting all the backend stuff- editing, organizing, and blogging. It's tiring, and the list of things I need to get done tomorrow is a mile and a half long. May or may not do all/some of it. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
