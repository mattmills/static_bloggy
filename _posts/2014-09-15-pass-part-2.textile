Anybody get the pun in the title? Passe-Partout? no? just me? ah well, I'm allowed to be a little goofy after the day I've had. this is the second part of the pass, where it got really amazing. For some reason I can only see these pictures with a ton of contrast, in black and white. Sorry if they're a little over wrought. It was sublime. Wilderness and danger all around, but pulling me further on. Of course, on the road, there was only a little danger, inherent in driving a winding two lane road.
