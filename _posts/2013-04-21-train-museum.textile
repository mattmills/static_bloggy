So, in Oklahoma there's a train museum; part of the centennial celebrations or something, but now it's the sort of place you "take your kids for their 2nd birthday":http://katality.com/augusts-2nd-birthday-a-vintage-train-party/. I was hungover as hell, so I sort of wandred off, as I do... Lots of interesting shapes and textures. 

Small museums have this quirkyness about them that's super endearing. There's at least one person that cares enough about trains to devote their life to preserving them. The museum itself is a work of art, an arrangement of forms and objects to convey a message. Really cool. 

Also Maeghan was there. Hi!
