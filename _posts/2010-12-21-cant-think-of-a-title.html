<p>Sometimes I think I&#8217;m being funny when actually I&#8217;m being unintelligible. The title of the last post is an example of that. anyway, yeah, tired, but making it through. Time off soon, and a nice little trip&#8230; things are happening again. It&#8217;s after the solstice and I&#8217;m breaking out of my winter doldrums. I hope.</p>
