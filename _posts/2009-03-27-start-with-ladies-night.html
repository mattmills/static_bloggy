What?"</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So, It's very early on friday morning, and I have about three posts in the queue. They're all vaguely about drinking, and/or bikes, and or insightful important need-to-know information. Those are the only types of posts I do, so we'll see if I can do them all in one feel swoop.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Sigrid was there, writing on people's knuckles.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Wednesday was the famous and ever popular ladies night at The Blue Note, and really it was a nice time. I walked in and there was Cyrus, chillin' at the bar with a new 'dew. I actually like the new hair better, even though it is a little funny to see Cyrus in a crew cut. I laughed, I admit it.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >For example: Reaghan.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />We were the two drunks at the end of the bar solving the world's problems. We came to the conclusion that people are better taken individually than in groups- there's some context missing, but that's what I remembered hung over this morning. That and a lot of pretty girls. Which brings me to the next part of the story. (You people reading this should realize that this narrative has a pretty good basis in fact, but I'm glossing over the boring parts of the evening).<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Then Cyrus upstaged all this knuckle writing by doing his whole forearm.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />New girl comes over, Jordan, we meet, get to talking, and it turns out she wants to be a Suicide Girl, but needs a photographer. I was, of course, doing my normal thing, taking drunkpictures at the bar, and so she asked me if I would do it, and me being an idiot, a sucker for a pretty lady, I said sure. So it's me and Cyrus and her hanging out and drinking, and one thing leads to another, and they're kind of talking, and then I look over and they're making out. Making out pictures don't do anything for me, but I snap a few anyway, because the impulse to document is still there.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Like I said, making out pictures don't do anything for me, but I love her surprised smile in this picture.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So I turn to Rachel, who was sitting at out table, and say something, chit chat like, and then Jordan says "Matt!" and pulls up her shirt. Reflexes and impulses being what they are, I snapped a couple frames. Demand all you want, but I'm not going to post that on the internet unless she tells me to, which is unlikely.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Does this look like a girl who would flash the camera for fun and profit? I like it, either way.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />From there, the night is a blur of the HiLo and then to Reaghan's new abode, where there was this somewhat interesting other girl, but then everybody passed out pretty quick, and nothing happened. Her name was Kat, I'm pretty sure, and I remember her asking about my camera earlier in the night. Maybe I'll run into her again. If not, it's the bus theory of meeting women. I'll let you work that one out while I'm working on the next post.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Walking back to my car, there was a random tractor.
