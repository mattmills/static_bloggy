We came into Bridgeport through the pass north of 120, I disremember which road it was. Stopped at an overlook, maybe half way down, that had a good view of the valley we'd been coming down, out of the sierras. Switchbacks the whole way, and I was driving, so didn't take too many photos (since I've nearly killed myself doing that, I only take the risk when I'm alone).

Got into Bridgeport, checked in to the motel there, and then went to see what we could see of the lake. It wasn't quite golden hour, but the closeness of the mountains meant that the whole lake was in shadow a couple hours before the official sunset. I took a couple pictures with the film camera from a nice overlook, which are still undeveloped, four months later. We proceeded to the visitors' center for the national monument, which was closed, so I ran around taking photos anyway. Then we lost the light so we went on to dinner and then back to the motel.

The next morning, I woke up early and went for a walk. There's not much left of Bridgeport. A couple bars, a couple hotels, and cattle ranches all around. And great big beautiful mountains.

There's a saying, 'The perfect is the enemy of the done,' that I've been contemplating lately. I have a hard time letting go of stuff that isn't perfect. Not only that. It's very hard for me to start something that I can't see the through line to completion. A friend on facebook brought it up in the context of cleaning, but it applies to blogging all the pictures, too. These are four months old, for crying out loud. They're pretty good. I think the third image is going to look great printed very large (40x60, for those that care). Anyway, this is me, not trying to get it perfect, but just getting the thing done.
