1. Getting ready for the first Oklahoma Citizen meeting wednesday-yes, the newspaper has a name, tentatively. I need to make an agenda, decide what I'm going to say, maybe put together a powerpoint, etc. etc. It's a lot of prep work.<br /><br />2. Laundry- I wore one clean sock today and one dirty sock. Enough said. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />3. House Cleaning- literally. My room has once more transformed into a series of piles, and the bathroom hasn't been scrubbed in a couple weeks. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />4. Physical therapy exercises- these take about ten minutes, and I'll probably do them right after I get done writing this. <br /><br />5. Promote <a href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/909837">my book</a>. Done. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />6. Process some of the pictures from the last few weeks. (The ones you're seeing here are from just after halloween. I have a bunch still in the camera from after that even). <br /><br />And that's it. My todo list for right now. What I should be doing. Instead, I'm waiting on a phone call to go out and celebrate somebody's birthday. No names, I am a gentleman after all. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
