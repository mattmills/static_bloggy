actually, everything is happening all at once, making blogging hella difficult. Gotta keep it real, and do you know, the real world is awesome? Exhibit A:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />This kid was standing on the edge of the canal and said, "Somebody push me in right now," and one of his friends did. I almost did myself, but the kid who did it was closer.<br /><br />Exhibit B:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />I was downtown last night, and for the first time in a long time, there was life, real people out having a good time as if OKC were a real city. It was nice.<br /><br />Exhibits C+D:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-4.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />I need to go shoot more, to see more, to find out more of this. And I think I'm going to do a series called "Pretty Women in Bars." That's all. Later Gator.
