This was the last hurrah before we left town. After this, I was in tahoe for a week, and then we came home and packed everthing. It was great to see everyone one last time; many people came out and I didn't get photos of them all. I was busy, I suppose. 

We had the main event at Picasso's, which there for a while was basically my kitchen. A perfect spot for 40 of our closest friends to say goodbye. And then we moved on to the Other Room, which didn't last long, and then ended up at the Mule. A good night to round things out, and then get up in the morning and get on a plane.
