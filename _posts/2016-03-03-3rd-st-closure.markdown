Last night, I was walking down third to get to Garaje. Normally I wouldn't go that far for dinner, but I had time to kill. I got to mission and third to find third completely blocked, including the sidewalk. The police seemed to have their hands full dealing with irate conference goers and drunk people (but I repeat myself), so I didn't ask them what was going on. I went around, New Montgomery to Howard. I walked down a mostly empty third street sidewalk, and found that the cops were turning people back at Folsom too. The whole street empty, traffic backed up on third from being redirected. 

I like this format; shoot a little essay between places, see something interesting, post it mostly from my phone. I'm not going after great truth or justice like I thought journalism should be when I was in school. I'm just looking at here and now, and seeing what I see.
