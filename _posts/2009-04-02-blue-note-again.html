title: Blue Note. Again.
date: 2009-04-02

At the blue note on a wednesday, although I started the night at McNellie's. It feels better to be making portraits, although I've lost all sense as to whether these are any good or not. I was just a little off the whole night (actually, for the last several nights) and  I can't put my finger on why, exactly. Oh well, it'll work itself out. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Cat gives me the crazy eye.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" >This is a look that says "I can't believe I've run into my ex" and "How can I get away from him?" Trust me, I was there.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" >Cyrus does normal? is this a fluke?</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
