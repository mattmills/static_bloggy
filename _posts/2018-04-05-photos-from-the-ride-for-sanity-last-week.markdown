Sometimes I do this; just take a day off, call in sick, and do whatever. Last thursday I woke up to my alarm and the knowledge that there was no way I was going to be a functional code monkey that day, so I called (actually slacked) in sick, and put in my time, and went back to sleep for four more hours. 

When I woke up, I had this desire to go for a long bike ride. I have this road bike, the one that I bought with the proceeds from the sale of my motorcycle, and I decided it was time to dust it off for the spring and go around a bit. So I did. 

BART to the city, and then down embarcadero to roughly fisherman's warf, and then across the north end of SF all the way to Fort Point. From there, up into the Presidio. My legs were very tired, but I kept going, all the way to Golden Gate Park. The spot I came into the park meant that it was basically the last hill I had to climb, and I rode downhill all the way from JFK and crossover to 2nd and Townsend. About 17 miles all told.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: riding a bike makes everything better.
