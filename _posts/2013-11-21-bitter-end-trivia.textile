This was one of the nights where we met out at the Bitter End, a bar in the Richmond. Decent food, good beers, great decor. It's a perfect dive bar, and far enough afield that it's a pretty good crowd, not all hyper-startup-world. Not to get all down on startups, I mean, I work at one, but there's something about the scene that makes me think it's all going to come crashing down eventually. Maybe I'm wrong, and that's oldthink. I do like to get away from it sometimes, though.
