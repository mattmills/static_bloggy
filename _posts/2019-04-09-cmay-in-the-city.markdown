This would have been something like 3 or 4 days before we left for Japan? So that makes me almost six months behind the moment on posting. Ah well. I really like the first image, all those different faces kind of lined up. The second one has two of the performers we were there to see, I think they were friends of friends of Christa's? The projector had like a bazillion dead pixels; the lines in the smoke-filled bar were kind of better than the projection.

I decided with these to just let them be sort of whatever contrast they were, and not mess with them too much. The one of the two people doesn't have sufficient depth, but I like their expressions well enough. I also don't understand why there were spotlights in the bathroom, but there were. I don't think either one of us was really feeling the vibe at this club, so we ducked out pretty quick.

Oh yeah: I'm selling my Leica. I started having those thoughts, all the stuff I was talking about in the previous post, and I was just going to put it on the shelf for a while, but then our taxes came in and we owe enough that coming up with the money other ways was going to be difficult. So, it's on ebay, along with the summicron. Oh well.

I'm a little bummed about it, but really the kind of images it's good at making aren't really what I want to be doing. I mean, look at this post: Side-on photos of people in the train, one slightly blurry portrait, and a couple static scenes. I want to be making good portraits. That's not to say the Leica isn't a good portrait camera, but it doesn't work that way for me.
