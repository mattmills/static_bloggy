So, the watch project continues apace; I've thrown out the initial design, that was based on the "OSWatch":http://oswatch.org/index.php ; I may still use some of his code, but for now my efforts are in getting a prototype up and running. I blabbed about the project on twitter, and a friend suggested I look at the RFduino, an arduino-compatible module that has a built-in bluetooth module. It's a pretty sweet little chip, except for the small problem that the bootloader is closed-source. I've decided to let that be a problem for another day, and run with it.
