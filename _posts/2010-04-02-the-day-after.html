<p>well, that might not have been the end of the night, but the pics got either not so good or at least repetitive (I photograph my obsessions at my best, and when I&#8217;m drunk it gets worse), so we&#8217;re moving on. <br/><br/>

This is the next day. Holly, mourning. And then getting ready to go to work. And then the cat.
