And by again, I mean for the first time. Hi everyone, even you people who were looking for "Matt Mills porn" in google. No porn here, just good clean photography. While I might occaisionally take pictures of scantily clad women, naked ones even (although that hasn't happened in a while; other things to do when I get naked with a girl, you know), there's no porn here, and don't hold your breath. Seriously, it's a little weird that someone is searching my name with porn. Could be worse. They could be searching "Matt Mills assassination."<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />It's been a good couple of days. <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.html">Tony</a> keeps on rocking out, although some easy to find permalinks would be nice. The top and third posts as of this writing, about needing to write every day, are awesome, the reason I keep going back to his blog, even when he's dragging, even when some weeks he only posts about shit I don't want to hear. Because in 7 years reading his blog, he's been consistently pulling out awesome writing like that, sooner or later. And all the hotchicks, I'm not gonna lie.<br /><br />So, the good news is that I'm doing all right. Several good things have happened to me in the last 24 hours. I had a primo steak for dinner, fresh french fries, all delicious. I then went and had coffee with Lora and Sabrina, two friends of mine, both of whom I owe pictures, sorry girls, I swear I'm on it right after I write this. Lora had to go home and sleep, she works, and I can't decide if I'm jealous of her having a job, you know, with income, or if I'm glad I'm not tied down like that, needing to be in bed by a certain time. Although that never stopped me from staying up before.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />So, that left me and Sabrina to run around town a bunch. Sabrina's an old friend, from high school, but I haven't seen her since last fall, so we had a bit of catching up to do. We talked for a while, drove around some, and got out and walked some too. The photos are from the walking and the driving. Yes, I take photos even when I'm driving sometimes. I do it really fast, and I never leave my lane, although sometimes a little swerving is involved. So yeah, we walked and talked, and before you know it it was 11:30 and Sabrina's husband was calling and asking where his wife was, and so we ambled back to the car and I took her home.<br /><br />Then I went home and read for a while. <a href="http://www.johndiesattheend.com/">John Dies at the End</a>  is a really cool story. A little disconnected at times, but worth reading. Really scary at points, too, something that few stories do for me. To answer the riddle at the beginning: No. By the way, the title is deceptive. That's all I'm saying.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />OK, so with that out of the way, I gotta go do up the photos. Peace everyone/MAtt
