<p>Sometimes there&#8217;s a moment when I see something and I realize the world is changing; we say things are different now but it doesn&#8217;t really affect the mood in my head, but then I see something like this guy hanging down from the broadway extension to do god knows what maintenance, and something clicks. Hundreds of feet in the air like some kind of hero, just doing his job. Not &#8216;everyday hero&#8217; but &#8216;this wasn&#8217;t possible before&#8217;; something outside my personal mythos. And then for a while my thoughts are colored by the fact the the world is bigger and stranger than even I thought; and that&#8217;s saying something.</p>
