So yeah, I did a lot of shooting an no editing, as I am wont to do, and it's taken a while for me to catch up even this much. At this momen, 100 photos are processing to jpeg, at which point they'll be postable again. I got through all the photos from camping, from one blue note show, from the week in cali, and the trips out and back. So those are all coming in the next couple days. 

Other good things that are happening. If you care about the day-to-day, you're probably already my freind on FB and twitter, so I won't bore you with repitition. Here's a nice picture of the moon to start.
