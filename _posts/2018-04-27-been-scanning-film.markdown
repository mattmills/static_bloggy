like the title says, I've been scanning a bunch of film tonight. Shot some today too, hopefully a few of those are good. this whole blogging every day has me short on things to post. I've got a couple big events lined up, odd salon with the 500mm and a fancy olive oil themed dinner, and a few little things, but the big pile of unpublished mess is no more. There's probably stuff in the archive that I could go fish for, like I did the post about trees. The trip out to see the trees was really memorable, but there's not a ton from last fall I want to go digging for or that I'm excited about. The past is passed. Onward!
