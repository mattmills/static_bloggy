<p>It&#8217;s been a long week and a half actually. Broken laptop and hospital time and exhaustion and stress. But on the other hand: drinking and good times and great friends and new beautiful women. really, I&#8217;ll take what I can get. and now I&#8217;m back on the air, everybody&#8217;s healthy (knock on wood) and my lappy is more or less restored. Done and done. <br />
