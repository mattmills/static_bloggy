The wiggle, fo those that aren't familiar, is the path of least resisitance from the east when crossing to the west in SF. It's still a bit of a climb, but every time you think "Holy crap, I have to go up that?!?," there's a right or a left turn, and it's not nearly as bad as you thought. 

One more note: it's really hard to take pictures while biking in traffic.
