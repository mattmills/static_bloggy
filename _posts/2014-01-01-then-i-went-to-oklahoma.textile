Can I talk about how much I didn't want to leave my freshly official wife for two weeks? Because I really didn't. I had to though; my mom got a kidney transplant, and I was needed to help out around the house, and I also personally needed to go out there and see her getting better. 

Anyway, I crossed about 1/2 the country before dinner, and I was exhausted at the end of it. Any flight that's too early to catch BART to get to out of SFO is officially off the table. (I've officially doomed myself to 6AM flights forever with that statement, I know).
