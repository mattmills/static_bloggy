I already posted this to twitter, but I figure more people will see it if I put it here too. I look at all those bike pieces scattered in the road, and I'm thinking, if my bike had been super light carbon, that'd be me. Lugged Steel Saved My Life. (For those that don't know: I was <a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/blog/2009/05/wreck.html">hit a couple weeks ago</a> by an inattentive driver).<br /><br />Text story <a href="http://artfa.gs/driver-kills">here</a> and video: <br /><script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.newson6.com/global/video/videoplayer.js?rnd=882102;hostDomain=www.newson6.com;playerWidth=400;playerHeight=340;isShowIcon=true;clipId=3849424;playerType=POPUP_EMBEDDEDscript'></script><br /><br />This is a sad day. My heart goes out to the dude in the hospital and the families of the dead. <br /><br />(another post to follow, more generally about sharing the road.)
