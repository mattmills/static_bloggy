So, we finished our 5k, went home, showered, and then got in the car to drive to Lawton, to Sophie's Aunt Marylyn's house. Beautiful little place, lots of good shapes and textures; you could tell it was a place that they'd designed and built themselves. 

The meal was at the family table, with an extension at one end. No kids table here. Good food, good people. And then we drove back to the city.
