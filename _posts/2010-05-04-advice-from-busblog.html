Kurtis: How do you get over someone?<br/><br/>

the only way is to get sloppy with several others. keyword: get. all this moping around, writing poems, feeling the depths of depression, etc - all thats played out. its the road most traveled. its for losers. its for the madding crowd. its for people who revolve their schedules around nickleback. first thing you should do this weekend is get a date, make some moves, and think about las vegas. yes you&#8217;ll feel horrible. but you were gonna feel horrible anyways. at least now when you wake up their will be stale champagne on the nightstand. and if youre lucky, it wont be all that stale.<br/>
