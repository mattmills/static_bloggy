<p>Went to this show on a monday, sometime before christmas. The poor first guy had almost nobody there&#8230; I think his mom was taking pictures at one point, while the rest of us were off in the bar area, waiting for Rico Muerte to play. He wasn&#8217;t bad, except all of his songs were about his girlfriend. Then RM came on, solid rock, then some dudes from savannah with way too much gear but decent sound and then I left before it was over because some of us have to work at 8:30 in the morning. I&#8217;m not happy about it, but that&#8217;s the way it is.</p>
