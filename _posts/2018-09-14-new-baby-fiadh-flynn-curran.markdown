Last weekend? Last week sometime? no, I remember, it was labor day, and we went to the only open sushi joint in greater oakland to pick up a meal and take it to the folks with the weeks-old baby. They're still in the thick of it, with the baby not sleeping through the night, or really for more than a couple hours at a stretch. Sounds miserable if you ask me.

Anyway, it was good to see them and catch up, at least for a couple hours. It's the silly season, one of those times when everything happens all at once and all I can do is try to show up and do my thing as well as I can.

I'm way behind on posting photos; this is from almost two weeks ago and I have a pretty big backlog. The Leica (which might need a name, come to think of it) has really got me producing a lot of photos. I'm not sure why, except it feels like I've got some skin in the game again, out there in the world with this camera. Like it's a big hunk of responsibility, and I need to be using it to make it worthwhile? I dunno. It helps that it's so freakin' awesome to work with, and the files that come out of it are so good. It's the same size / number of pixels as my other cameras, but it just feels more refined.
