I may or may not have talked about this before, but there's a whole lot of my photography that's a love affair with the city. It is a place full of wonders, and ad the same time a place that can crush you for a simple case of bad luck. It is a big place, and getting bigger by the minute. These photos are some of my exploration of that, I suppose. All but the last one, which was good in a completely different way.

You may have noticed I've been neglecting this blog; it's beacuse I've been working on "another project":http://unnaturaldiphthongs.com/. While that isn't done, it is at least in a good state for now. I'm waiting on boards and parts and tools to make version two. I won't bore you with details, except to say you've probably never seen a toaster oven used "this way":http://hackaday.com/2012/03/08/toaster-oven-reflow-soldering-roundup/ before.
