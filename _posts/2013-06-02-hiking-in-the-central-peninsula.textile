I don't know why I never hiked in Oklahoma, but I've been doing a lot of it here. Maybe because the city is more dense here, or maybe it's the nicer weather. In any case, this was a nice little day trip we took down to the central peninsula. I took the film camera and the digi, and I think they both have their place. I need to get a wide angle for my x-pro, though.
