<p>Today is a weird ass day&#8230; I keep doing that thing you&#8217;re supposed to do in lucid dreams where you look at everything twice, to tell if I&#8217;m awake or not. Man, people in the hospital, (everyone is fine now as far as I know) sudden revelations, breakfast tacos, madness.  
<br/><br/>
Yesterday, I lost my voice. I said to Reaghan: &#8220;I took a shot of Tom Waits,&#8221; because when I could talk, that&#8217;s who I sounded like. This morning, eating my taco, I heard in my head his reading of Bukowski&#8217;s poem &#8220;Nirvana&#8221;: &#8220;Not much chance. Completely cut loose from purpose&#8230;&#8221; Oh the <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-have-an-ipodin-my-mind,10912/" target="_blank">ipod of the mind</a>.

Anyway, here are some entirely unrelated photos:
