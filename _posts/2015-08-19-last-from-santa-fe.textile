Sinced I got these off the camera yesterday, figured I could post them today. It was a good trip, filled with memories and delicious burritos from The Pantry. We were staying out towards Cerillos, on a friend of a friend's family vacation home. A really beautiful spot. The storms coming in over the valley at sunset were amazing.

I was a little suprised at how big Cerillos has gotten. Boom town, maybe from the movie business that came through, maybe because of the light rail between SF and ABQ. I'm not sure, but it seemed like there were a few too many kitch stores for the long run. It'll be interesting to see what happens with that little place, next time I visit. Hopefully it won't take 7 years next time.
