<p>So, yeah. Came home, and then the haloween madness started. Kj drove, which meant I got to sleep, wonderful road-weary sleep, and I woke up and there was a sunset and we were nearly there. I wonder if you know how fucking wonderful that is? A moment of calm and peace, after one set of mad adventures and before the next.</p>
