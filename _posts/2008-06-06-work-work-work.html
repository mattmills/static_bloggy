All week long, so not much to talk about. Although everyone's been asking me wether or not I like my job at work which leads me to believe that someone there has been reading the blog... well, the answer is, I really do like my job. OK? I really like the paycheck, and I know that long term (I'm thinking in years here) it's not what I'm going to end up doing. I get to meet lots of people, push myself in interesting ways. Organization, never my strong suit, is critical, and so I'm learning how to do it. I get to meet interesting people, and one of my strong suits, being endearing to the surly, is a big help some places. <br /><br />My existential doubts the other day (and what I wrote here) were really me thinking out loud. Sometimes I write because I have a good idea, a story to tell. Sometimes I have an idea to work out and if I write it down I can see it better. Then there's what I did the other day: putting my doubts and fears down so I can see if they're real or not after a little time has passed. <br /><br />Now a little time has passed and I've been working and getting a better feel for what is going on, and it's a good thing, for the most part. The problems I have with corporations, big oil, etc. are political problems. This work isn't political in the least. It's just a low level function of a market economy. A demand for information is being filled. <br /><br />Anyway, I need a nap. Photos to follow later, before booze cruise.
