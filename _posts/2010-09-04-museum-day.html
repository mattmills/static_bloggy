<p>Went to the Cairo Museum yesterday. I met this New Zealand fellow, Kim, and he was going, and so I went. Photos were against the rules in the museum though, so unfortunately you&#8217;ll have to go yourself to see such wonders as the burial mask of king tut and 12.5 million tiny statues of every pharaoh ever. Today we&#8217;re going to the world&#8217;s oldest tourist trap, the pyramids. Should be a fun morning. Then I really need to get some programming done. Money is officially short.</p>
<p>Jackson Pollack once said: &#8220;All I ever wanted to do was paint sunlight on the side of a house,&#8221; or something to that effect. I know exactly what he meant.</p>
