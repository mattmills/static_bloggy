A week ago, I went down to medicine park to assist <a href ="http://www.jeremycharles.com">Jeremy Charles</a> with a little advertorial. Hold the reflector, keep the lights from blowing away, that sort of thing. While I was there, I had a little down time to walk up the main drag and shoot a few pics of the town, and while details were being decided, I was able to shoot the little kid who was the subject of the ad in question. It was nice to get out and shoot in the mode of dropping into a location, gestalting, and shooting pictures based on those impressions. <br /><br />It's also always nice to work with a pro of Jeremy's caliber, someone who knows their look, knows their gear, lights, who "gets it." That said, working with a family of four who are inexperienced in front of the camera, and having two small kids in that mix, was stressful.    <br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0009.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0010.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0011.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0012.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0013.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0014.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0015.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0016.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0017.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0018.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>
