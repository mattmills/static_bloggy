Today is my first day with "Engine Yard":http://engineyard.com. Last night, I got to go out with a couple of the managers and one of the other new hires, and I really like their style. Also, had some really awesome food and drink wandering around downtown Vancouver. 

Earlier, I wandered a bit- just down to the bay from my hotel, really. Saw the Olympic torch, heard about four languages (Welsh, something scandanavian, chinese, and japanese), and had pangs of longing for living in a real city. Also, they have hills here: real, steep, make you regret a fixed gear hills. I wish I had my bike. Tons of people here on bike, too. I love cities.
