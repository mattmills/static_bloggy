So, all of the Engine Yard offices I've been in have ping pong tables. Secret to our success? Maybe. There is something about taking a break to do something physical while you're thingking really hard on a problem for a long time. Moving around makes you forget some of the rigidity you had built up around the problems, and you have headspace then for solutions. I don't really play ping pong, but I pace, I dance, whatever works. Sometimes I just need to staer out the window for a little while. 

There's a stillness that you're after, really. It's the creative space. The moment of quiet before ideas come rushing to fill it. Stretching that moment out is Zen meditation (and one of the reasons I have a zen symbol tatooed on my arm). The longer you can stretch that moment out, the louder the ideas get. Sometimes, something really brilliant will come, other times, it's just a solution to a tricky process problem. 

I know I should just post single images to twitter, but that's so much harder to get to later, and this format makes the photos look better. Also, this is a good excuse to air my stupid ideas.
