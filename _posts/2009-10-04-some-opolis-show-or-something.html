Friday was fun as shit. Definitely the best night out I've had in a while that didn't involve getting far too drunk. Actually, there was drinking, of course. But the funness was from the dancing and the company, Amber and Kat and some of their friends, oh yeah, and I saw Grizzly Bear's tour bus.  At least, that's what someone said it was. No idea who these bands were, forgot their names already, go to the opolis web site and look i9f you care, but they honestly weren't that great, or I would have written the names down or shot the poster or something. But the night as a whole was a blast. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Ghost Bike:</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This guy sucked.
