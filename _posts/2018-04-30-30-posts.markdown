I made it! this post, half an hour before midnight on the last day of the month, makes 30 posts, or an average of one a day for the month of April. Woot! Here's a rainbow to celebrate (this was actually the next photo on the queue, by a quirk of serendipity). The clouds were actually just the view in the opposite direction, a couple minutes later. Done!
