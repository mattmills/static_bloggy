Tuesday, I went out for a bike ride, just to get a little air, and ended up at the blue note, which has become my bar of first resort. I actually made really good time on the ride in, at least for me: 7 miles in half an hour. <br /><br />When I got there, Chris was sitting at the bar (hi chris). Next thing I know, I'm doing an irish car bomb with him and Victoria, and the night rolls out from there.  A couple beers and a couple shots later, we head back to Chris' house. On the way, I confirmed what I'd heard earlier in the day: my work had all been taken down from Sauced. It's gone, and I'm pissed. Fuck Sauced. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Eyeing a bolt-hole to attach the chain guard. </span><br /><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, we got to Chris' house, which he shares with KW, and I watched Lisa put the finishing touches on her bike. It's a cute girl cruiser, fashionable and functional. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >The bike.

I always pass by this last scene, but for some reason early on April Fool's day, it grabbed me. Who cares if I look foolish? Nobody was around, anyway. <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
