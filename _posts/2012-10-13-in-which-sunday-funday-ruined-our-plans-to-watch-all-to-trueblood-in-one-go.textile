So we went over to Hunter's the sunday after we got back from Colorado, and we watched a chunk of trueblood, something like the first five of the last season. Then he got a text from a friend, inviting him out to the hilo. Then all this happend:

Two hours later, we went and watched a few more episodes, and then called it quits. Still haven't finished it.
