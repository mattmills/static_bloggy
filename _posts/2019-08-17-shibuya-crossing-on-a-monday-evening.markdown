Just moving between places in Tokyo. There's so much happening there at any given instant. This was just another Monday evening, you know? but I guess someone else's quotidian bullshit can be amazing and wild if you go halfway around the world. This crowd _was_ a nice change from the Halloween night crowd, which was called a riot by the local police. (I for one don't think it can be a riot without any broken windows, at least; this was just TOO MANY PEOPLE in one place)

Schedule is already filling up for the fall. Booking things two months out _already_. Two more weeks until I start physical therapy. I keep having dreams where I'm walking, and after a moment I look down and realize I'm still in the splint, or I shouldn't really be putting weight on the busted ankle, but it seems fine in the dream. I hope reality is half as easy.
