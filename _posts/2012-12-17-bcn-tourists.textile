These are sort of more street photos, I'm realizing, but I was setting out to document something specific. Tourists are sort of weird. I mean, I totally was one, too. But You could tell tourists from natives at a glance. Not just the cameras or the different-than-local fashion, but the way they move and cluster. They pose for photos, they're always a little tired and seem a little put-upon. Everything about them says "I'm not at home here."
