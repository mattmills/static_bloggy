The perfect evening is one that starts with "Let's meet up for lunch," and goes from there. This was one of those. It started meeting up for tacos, then it was movie night in Dolores, which quickly fizzled when we couldn't hear or see (protip: get there early if you want either of those things). So, we went to the house, and thence to several bars, just sort of moving along on impulse. The larger the group, the harder this is, but it's pretty good when it works.
