<p>It&#8217;s wonderfully quiet here. I&#8217;ve only been here an hour and I&#8217;m already more relaxed. Got a meal, got my room, a shower, etc, etc. Internets is spotty and costly here. We&#8217;ll see if they change the password on me or what. Might just be incommunicado for a few days. Put the &#8220;get away&#8221; in get away from it all.</p>
<p>Meantime, bus rides are boring, except when there are pretty things to photograph out the windows. I can&#8217;t complain. The Sinai is pretty rad looking. Erm&#8230; yeah. not a lot to say. Photos! Yeah! Look:</p>
