I think this was April? Might have been early May. Wasn't June, that just started. Hella grainy; this is P3200 exposed at 3200, and then scanned with a little too much sharpening in the scanner software. I can't really be bothered to re-scan (if you knew what a headache scanning is, you'd agree).

I've built up a pretty good backlog again, mostly of film work, but some with the fuji too, so I'm going to try posting at least once a day until the backlog is back down to manageable size. Don't know if I'll have a ton to say, but we'll see.

Here's today.
