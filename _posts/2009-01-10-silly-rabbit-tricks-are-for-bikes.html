So, I've been a little lax in posting photos the last few days. Chalk it up to new year depression. January always gets me down, and it takes a few days for all the old habits to kick in and pull me out of my funk. It's been a good couple of days though. <br /><br />Sarah and Damaris see the green fairy:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I'm officially a pedicab driver: <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Add to that the other new job, the one where I'm officially a professor, and it couldn't get more ridiculous. Unless of course you're Steves with a tablecloth on your face:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />The litter box session was pretty good too:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0007.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0008.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0009.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0010.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0011.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />The next night, at the ever popular 3020:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0012.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Karaoke at the raintree:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0013.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />This last one comes with a public service announcement. There is a reason Old Milwaukee is so cheap. Do not try to play asshole with that shit unless you're prepared for a monster hangover. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0014.jpg" alt="Photos" />
