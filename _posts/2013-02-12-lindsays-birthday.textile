These were all from Sophie's (and my) friend Lindsay's Birthday party. We all got really drunk; Sophie and I walked and took cabs, and I think mot everybody else did the same. Which was a good thing, because for the latter half of the evening, a majority of the party was blacked out. No, not me; I wasn't trying to kill any more brain cells than I already have. 

If I keep doing these posts in pairs, I might get caught up to the present _just_ before I have to go to Tahoe and get three weeks behind again (A week in Tahoe, a weekend to move, a couple weeks to find an apartment/adjust to life in SF).
