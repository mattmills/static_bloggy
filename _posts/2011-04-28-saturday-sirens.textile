These are the last photos in the queue to be posted; luckily, today, I got contacts, and I can see again. By see, I mean see pictures, not just focus on stuff. I can already tell, it's better this way. Which I really knew all along. Anyway, photos...

These are from a totally excellent show I went to at Belle Isle. The Saturday Sirens played a great set. thanks "&#64;jane4oh5":http://twitter.com/#!/jane4oh5 for tweeting about it, because it was a rad time.
