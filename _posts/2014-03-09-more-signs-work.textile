It occurs to me that I'm going to have to come up with a better name for this work. There's a feeling at the heart of it, about being lost, coming unmoored. It's a thread that's run through my work since I did "the world doesn't make any sense":http://bit.ly/1fiShkO work. That book was also where I learned the hard way to hate gutter bleeds. The PDF is ok if you view it with two pages together though. Back to what I was saying though: I look at those pictures today and I see how far I've come, and yet I'm still pretty much just groping around in the dark.

Why are you reading confused and confusing shit on the internet? Go outside and take some pictures.
