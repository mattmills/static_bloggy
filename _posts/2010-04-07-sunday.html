<p>Was peaceful and really nice. A calm day with a good drunk at the right end of it. Also, got to hang out with: <br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/aprilfoolish/0020.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/>And, even though you only see her knees/hands/arms, Victoria was there too.

And then I met (or re-met, depending on how drunk you have to be on a first meeting for it not to count) Jessica: <br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/aprilfoolish/0022.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/>
A good day. 

And I know I went and got these pictures up mad quick. Don&#8217;t get used to it.</p>
