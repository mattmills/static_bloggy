So, some pictures got stuck at the top of the queue, because i haven't been offloading the GoPro, or they didn't have a place in a bigger post. Anyway, here they are. Life is very good, and very strange. Many things could come along and knock it all down, all out of my control. All I can do is keep shooting.

The first pictre was taken the night of my 30th birthday. I'm OLD now. Then, some photos from the first trip to Big Sur, which had me sick in the back of the car with some kind of shitty flu. I took a ton of cold medicine and powered thru (with naps, OLD MAN). The last two pictures were from my trip down to San Diego, for work stuff. The work filled the day so that I was near dead at the end, no energy to even look around the hotel room for crappy picturs I'd ignore later. Which is honestly about where I am now. Except I need to write up where I'm at with the watch over on "that blog":http://ourglass.watch . I've had some pretty good progress.
