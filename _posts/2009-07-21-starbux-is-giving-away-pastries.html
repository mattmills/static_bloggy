And I'm not drawn in by their evil conspiracy. It's taken years, but now they're finally making a move. Wake up, Sheeple! <br /><br />(At least one person reading this will get the joke. The rest of you, don't worry, I'm not any more unhinged than I ever was).<br /><br />I'm writing this from my restored and much loved macbook. Friday night, before I went out to shoot these pictures, I was leaning over my desk to grab my bike off of the wall, and I knocked over a 16oz cup of coffee right into the computer. I knew there was nothing I could really do then; the best thing to do is let it dry first. So I did, I went off to the party, had a good time, (moar hellkats=more good times), and rode home. <br /><br />Next day, I tried to restart it, no dice, so I opened it up and there was a ton of gunk on everything, of course. Coffee+2.5yrs of dust, pretty much. Disheartened, I gave up and went to Mcnellies to be attacked by the photographer from lookatOKC. No, I don't want my picture taken. No, I won't sign a release. Go talk to the wedding party. It's my own fault for wearing my houndstooth fedora; that thing draws attention like whoa. <br /><br />Paperazzi deflected (yeah, I'm aware of the irony, but at least I know the people I take pictures of), I went home, and little elves hadn't come in and fixed my laptop, so the next day (sunday), I started dousing it with alcohol, and then I had the bright idea to get out a toothbrush and scrub away the crud. I let it dry overnight, plugged everything together, and it worked on the first try. Go me. <br /><br />also: the more I use my new camera, the more I love it. I've already shot 2000 photos with it. ok, fine, I'll shut up about it already. But the good news keeps on coming, I have a job interview tomorrow, I fixed this laptop, etc. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
