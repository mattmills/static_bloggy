<p>So, last night I had this dream that I got to egypt and somehow had forgotten my cameras, all of them, and all I could get was a film camera, and the only film I could find was ISO 100 color film, and 120-size black and white. Thought you&#8217;d like to know that. 
<br/><br/>
Also of note: If you&#8217;re staying at my house and happen to see me before I shower and wake up for a couple hours, I&#8217;m not really human yet. Cro-magnon or something till about noon.
