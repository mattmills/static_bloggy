<p>By which I mean I have the white stripes in my head. I&#8217;ve been reading this book, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Photographer-War-torn-Afghanistan-Doctors-Without/dp/B003F76HKC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1276983196&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Photographer</a>, about a photog who went into afghanistan with <a href="http://www.msf.org/" target="_blank">MSF</a> during the Soviet-Afghan war. Towards the middle of the book, the photographer and one of the doctors are talking about what it takes to improve in their respective professions, and the doctor says to the photog: &#8220;&#8230;To take good photos, you have to age well.&#8221; I like that sentiment very much. <br/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0006.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0007.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0008.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0009.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0010.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0011.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/></p>
