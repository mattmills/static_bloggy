<p>well, this is a first. I'm up at 5 am, really awake at this hour for the first time in years. had a good day yesterday, and I'm planning on having another one today. I had a date, too, and I've got another one of those coming today, too. If you ever hear me complaining about my life, feel free to tell me to fuck off. (Now, that's different than bitching about oklahoma, which is as much a pastime here as bitching about the weather...)</p>
