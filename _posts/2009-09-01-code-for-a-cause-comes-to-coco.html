So saturday was a busy day, spent mostly recovering from friday in the morning, but I did manage to stop by the <a href="www.okccoco.com">CoCo</a> for a minute to snap a few pictures of code for a cause, a really neat charity that provieds web site makeovers for nonprofits. 600 hours of web design and coding all compressed into one day. Pretty awesome. Wish I could have stayed longer. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
