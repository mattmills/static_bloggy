Couple photos... Went to sleep on Timmy & Ali's couch, woke up when Ali got home after the bars, hung out with all these dudes. Tulsa=Coolsville thus far. My team won at trivia, although I don't think I contributed more than one or two answers. Bike Against hunger got some money, and some gift certificates on top of that. Today's adgenda includes a bike shop and finding whole foods.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alishouse/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alishouse/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alishouse/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>
