I don't know why the word 'floffee' came to describe the coffee runs we make in the afternoon, or why there's an l in there. Fletch, who coined the term, claims it means "fancy coffee," because we've been going to this tiny hole in the wall on maiden lane instead of the pete's down on mission.

Anyway, there's a natural lull in the day, when the food from lunch is really solidly digesting, and 6pm (my office is 9-6, don't get me started) seems like forever from now, so we generally get up and stretch at least, and usually someone will suggest coffee, and the rest of us will say hells yeah. We come out of the mental fog for a couple minutes, and then back to work.
