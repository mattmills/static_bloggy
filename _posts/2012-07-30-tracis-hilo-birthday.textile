So, there was a lot of wildness this night, including a dude with leopard print tattoos over 90% of his body. Singing, dancing, and that was just in the living room. 

Than we went to the Hilo in cabs (for those of you in real cities, fuck you for having cabs that show up within 15 minutes when you call), proceecded to get hammered, then the dfry for fries at last call; we nearly lost Jay to some dude, and had to circle around twice to get him. 

Props to (in no particular order): The Morracan cabbie that dealt with our drunk asses, the bartenders at both bars, my downstairs neighbors for not calling the authorities, and finally, to Sarah, Reaghan, Sophia (who was somewhat new to this madness at the time), and of course, the birthday girl, Traci.
