<p>The same day as barcamp (man, I was tired when I started that day, and near dead by the end), I went to my first banked-track roller derby match, between the Red Dirt Rebellion, and some team from florida. <span class="caps">RDR</span> lost, but it was fun to watch and take photos of, anyway. The long lens shots were with my trusty 500mm mirror lens. Manually focused pictures of fast movement at slow shutter speeds. That&#8217;s why I make the big bucks (somebody hire me please?).</p>
