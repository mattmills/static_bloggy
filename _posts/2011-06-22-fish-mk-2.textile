So the longest day of the year is behind us, and lots of good things are going on behind the scenes. In front, though, there's this lens. This is version two of the thing, with the aperture control. I don't remember (and I'm too lazy) if I mentioned this here before, but I like the photos and don't mind another lens-specific post. I made it from some copper and stainless tubing and a projection lens from a TV, along with some parts from a broken 35mm that I had laying around. I need to get my bag back together and start carrying this thing again. 

Anyway, photos! These are from the last really bad stormy night; tornados in Blanchard and Edmond. Next: fish and friends!
