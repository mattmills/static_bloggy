I may have talked about this, but with my new job, for some reason I find it harder to get up on time to take the ferry. So for a while there, I only had one form of commute, and it was boring, and my instageam likes fell way off. More recently, though, I've started ferry-ing again. It really is a lot nice way to start the day. much less crowded, never too hot, and as a result, a lot more civil. I brought this up to a fellow passenger, and they said, "Well, we're all in the same boat." 

I've been thinking lately about this idea that I got from N. Scott Momaday's _In the Bear's House_, where one of the characters says "All stories are true." It's a koan for me; there are a lot of way to approach the idea, and a lot of layers to it. Obviously not all stories are ture on their face, but they all tell us something. About the tellers, about ourselves, and hopefully, about the world. "Storyteller" isn't far removed from "teacher", after all. I wish I could remember a little more of the context around that statement from the book, but I loaned my copy of it out and never saw it again some years ago.
