This was also last fall, and while I generally avoid posting pictures of people's faces protesting, I don't think there's a good reason to do that here. It's in one of the most heavily photographed areas of San Francisco, and there were tons of other people around shooting video and stills and posting them to whatever social network. It's been months, and the strike is won. That out of the way...

So in the last post I was like "yadda yadda no major site updates here's some photos" but I realized I didn't say way that was, or what might be preventing me from actually doing those updates. And instead of just going to edit that post, I figured I could just throw up another post instead.

So, the reason the whole blog redesign/replatform isn't happening yet is that I'm working on several other projects and I also am back to work, which means during the day, I'm workin' for the man. The first project, and definitely the one I'm most excited about, is the tiny laptop. I'm making a laptop in a roughly 4.5"x9" footprint, to serve as a travel machine. I've got some of the parts inbound and some more of them already here. Also, there's the solar light project that I'm working on for a friend. Not sure how much of that is under wraps, but it's a thing, and I have a raft of browser tabs open and I'm working on parts in Kicad.

Finally, there's the bag venture, which is still a thing. I'm looking at Dyneema fabrics for the next one, which will be a similar style to the last one, but I'm also waiting for the fabric to be in stock. I've got a whole bolt of Codura in black, I'll probably do something with that also.

Fun times. Things are happening here at Mills Studios. Not a lot of them photographic, although all that work is also ongoing; I may have my first lead on a portrait subject for PROJECT SAN PABLO. I need to come up with another photo project to work on in the interim, since that's kind of stalled out. Something will come to me, it always does.
