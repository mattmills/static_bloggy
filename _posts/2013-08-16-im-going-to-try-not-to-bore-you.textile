I don't want to bore you with tourist pictures, but I took a lot, and they made the edits, so this is one of two posts. I was ruthless editing these. Seriously. Anything redundant, or slightly boring got cut. I did about two days worth of actual tourism in my almost two weeks there; the rest of the time was spent working and laying around.
