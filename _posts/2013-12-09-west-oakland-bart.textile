A friend told me that I was in danger of all of my photos becoming just pictures of my commute. I mean, I'm basically there anyway. Documenting the life of a late 20's tech worker. I'm not sure that's all I want to be doing. So, notice those little red buttons up there in the top nav? There's a new one for my portfolio. Click it, and let me know what you think at my email (also linked above). If you're hiring a photographer in the bay area and like it, let me know.

In case you're wondering, no, I'm not quitting my current job; I can do both, so I'm going to, and see where it takes me.
