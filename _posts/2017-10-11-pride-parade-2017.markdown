A lot of pictures in this one, and I'm not sorry. Pride is such a visually overwhelming spectacle.

We got up a little late, I don't remember why, but we were starving, so we went to Rudy's first thing, got a great breakfast, and then hopped on the BART. Got off at Civic Center, and watched the parade from there for a couple hours. At least it seemed like a couple hours. Timestamps say an hour and a half. A lot of huge showings from tech companies, and a lot of really wonderful community groups too.

<Insert informed political dialog everyone else already had several months ago about the corporatization of Pride and the attempted rainbow-washing of companies' reputations>

I've just changed jobs (now, October 2017), and I'm two and a half days in, and I couldn't be happier that I did. I started my new job monday, and yesterday, on the way home, I actually felt like taking pictures. I was _tired_ after 6 hours of pairing, but I wasn't drained in the same way I was coming home from my former employer. That's fucking fantastic. As someone who draws a great deal of self worth from creative projects, I can't overstate how great that is.

And! look at me, blogging again! who knows, it might become a habit.
