So last sunday, there was brunch and basketball watching at BBell's house, and the dudes got inspired to go play a little pickup game in the alley, shirts vs. skins. I think skins won by 7 points. Then they realized due to the location of the basket relative to a certain ledge that they could all dunk. So that happened. Today I'm working, and then I'ma ride my bike later. Fun and adventure and really wild things. 

I see this post and the last post and I marveled at the fact that all those pictures happened in the same world. It's no surprise, reflecting on this, that people get lost going from one place to another.
