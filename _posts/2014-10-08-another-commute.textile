It appears as though the cranes are spreading to the East Bay now. It's only a matter of time till we all have to decamp for portland; there'll only be room for cranes left.

I do hope that by continuing this daily photography, a subject will emerge. There are a lot of things that I end up photographing over and over and over; the light changes, the fog rolls in, and I'm still shooting. That said, all this could be all terribly banal bullshit. When I'm at my most self doubting, that's all I can see. I'm not sure if the repitition or the persistence will work, either. We'll see, won't we? I don't have it in me to quit.
