Today was great; I got to meet a bunch of cool hardware folks (and "one novelist":http://robinsloan.com) at "@genmon's":http://interconnected.org/home/ hardware-ish coffee. Lots of good ideas flying around, and everybody seemed to like the "watch":http://ourglass.watch . Some other fellows had an interesting museum-y thing, and another guy had a bunch of little gadgets he'd made based on the electric imp. I'll update this with a link to Matt's post when he puts it up, with actual names. I was too busy sort of absorbing all the good ideas to really take it in. 

But: Look at that photo of Tom. Sunburnt as hell and not a single fuck given.
