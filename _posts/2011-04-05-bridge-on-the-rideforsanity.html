<p>this was on my first ride of the river trail for the season; I go out there once or twice a week and ride my troubles away. Or at least regain some calm and focus and put things into perspective. As I said somewhere near the inception of the five years blog that preceded this one, &#8220;Midnight bike rides fix Everything.&#8221; While they don&#8217;t, in fact, they always make me feel better.</p>
