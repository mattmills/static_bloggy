So we're still here, still haven't seen any shows, and if it weren't for our gracious and intelligent host, we wouldn't even have had and free beer. Austin is really going to have to kick it up a notch to save itself from this one. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Beginning of the night, all dressed up, still hopeful.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />We went to the party 45 minutes early and there was already a line a couple hundred people long. For some reason, when you tell people free beer and hot DJ's, they line up like it's the cure for stupidity. And then stand there. For two hours. While people cut, and get to go in vip. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >On the way, the night looked promising.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Seems to me it's an intelligence test. It sounds like a good idea to go stand in line for a little while and get a bunch of free shit- booze, music, hot, scantily clad women etc. There's a limit to how much you can stand there though, and here's where the intelligence test comes in: the smarter you are, the sooner you leave. When we left, there were still 200 people standing in line, not about to get in. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >The line, when we got there. Seemed like we'd get in.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Now, they were at capacity when they stopped letting people in, I'm sure. But after a bunch of people leave, why not let the people at the front of the line in? Instead, they were only allowing VIP's, which unfortunately, we're not. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >The same line, 45 minutes later.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />So, we gave up after about an hour of just standing there. In our defense, there were maybe 20 people in front of us; it seemed possible, when they said they were at capacity, that we might get in after some people left. Then we came back to the house, (Todd's house) and drank beer and talked late into the night with todd, todd's friend who works for SNL, and his girlfriend, who's name I've forgotten. Longtime blogreaders and friends will know this is because I'm horrible with names.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was as far as we got. Then we gave up and commenced drinking.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos"/>
