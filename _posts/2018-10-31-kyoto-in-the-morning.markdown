First morning, Kyoto. We woke up early, rolled over, and went back to sleep. So far this trip, jet lag hasn't been too bad, but we've been in a state of continual tiredness that is probably at least partially because of the interruption to our poor circadian rhythms. Anyway...

We were staying on the quieter side of the river, still fairly close to the central shopping district, and founds a lot of stuff nearby that seemed interesting. There was a nice little coffee shop that only served coffee of very high quality and really just a delight. We went to a smaller temple in the vicinity, just kind of wandered around the grounds. It was the sort of place that had been there continuously for 800 years or so, modulo a couple fires and rebuildings.
