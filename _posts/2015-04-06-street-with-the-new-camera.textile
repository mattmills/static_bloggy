The first few weeks of the new camera where all about things that previously I couldn't shoot. Anything dark, anything moving, and pretty much anything at all once I got going. I shot 200 pictures of basically nothing the first day. I kept up that pace for at least a week. If I had somethign to shoot, it was even more. A lot of pictures. I'm beginning to come to grips with what that means. I'm going to have to blog a lot more. Maybe be a bit less cautious. Post with wild abandon.

If you hate the picutes, there'll be another post along, shortly, to replace them at the top of the feed.
