You know that game where you look around you and guess who is the spy? If you can't guess who it is, it's you. There's a party version of the game, but it's called 'Rando'. A party is defined by the quality of its randos (to steal a great line from [busblog](http://busblog.tonypierce.com/2003/05/you-know-your-party-is-going-well-when.html)). You know, the guy that has that awesome story from that time about the thing, or brings the host's favorite type of liquor or is just witty as shit. Well, I was at this party and looked around, and sure enough, I was one of the randos. This is a good enough crowd where there were several and all hella interesting.

The crowd was some people I know from odd salon (Hi Barbara!), but Mike (picture 2) invited me to this shindig. I got there, took a bunch of pictures, but I was drinking straight gin at first, so the latter ones aren't so great. I ended up hanging out and talking with people till there were maybe half a dozen hangers-on, and took a drunken cab ride home. A wonderfully pleasant evening.
