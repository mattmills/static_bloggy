So, these are a couple months old at this point. It was Cynthia's 70th birthday. We celebrated over a long weekend in Estes Park, Colorado, staying in a house up on the hill. It was really a beautiful place and my inherited family is really good company. Since this is a photo heavy post, I'm gonna let the captions tell the story

<span class="caption">I think this was also day 2. We drove up into the park (Rocky Mountain National Park), and went on a little hike. When the hike starts at 12000 feet, it's no small feat to get to the top.</span>

<span class="caption">Getting Down is the easy part, they said.</span>

<span class="caption">Then we went for another hike, this on blessedly flat and only at about 8000 feet.</span>
