<p>All of these look a little yellow to me now, but I&#8217;m not going to go back and correct &#8216;em. Too much like work. I&#8217;m having a really great day thus far. Bike ride, hangin&#8217; out, big truck burrito, and now I&#8217;m huddled next to my ac tryin to cool off. The hot laptop isn&#8217;t much help, but oh well. <br/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0001.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0002.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0003.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0004.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0005.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/></p>
