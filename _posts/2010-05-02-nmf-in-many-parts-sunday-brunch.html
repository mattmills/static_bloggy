<p>So, Amber was kind enough to let me and Chas and her bro crash at her house, even leaving the front door open so we didn&#8217;t have to leave the party when she did. The next morning, Amber and josh and I had brunch at the Norman Airport. It&#8217;s a place to go to based on novelty, because the service sucked and the food wasn&#8217;t even as good as ihop.
