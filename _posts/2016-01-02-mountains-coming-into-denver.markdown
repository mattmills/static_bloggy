I flew home to see my folks just after christmas. There was a cheap flight I found at the last minute, probably a glitch, but it went through, so I went. They were happy to see me and I wished I'd had more time to spend with them, but there's never enough time.

On the way out, since I'd gotten up at 2:30am to get to the airport, I fell asleep in my seat, and woke up about 45 minutes before landing. I looked out the window, and before my eyes adjusted, I thought I was looking at some great desert, an infinity of dunes stretched out before me. The light was orange with the dawn, and everything was covered in snow. As the sleep fog in my head cleared, I realized what I was looking at, and began to photograph. The mountains are breathtaking this time of year, especially from altitude.

The plains, to the east, are harsher, even as they are flat and regular. There's nothing to hold on to out there; just a few farm buildings and Jefferson grid roads. Cold white and not much else. I was glad that both airplanes boarded from a jetway, and not a walk across the tarmac.
