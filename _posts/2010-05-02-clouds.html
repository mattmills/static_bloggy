<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this thing now for the past couple weeks, when I see a cloud that I like, for whatever reason, I take a picture. Clouds are the ultimate transients. Impossible to pin down. The way the light plays on them is so <i>dramatic</i>, as if they have moods. 
<br/><br/>
Anyway, I&#8217;m thinking of using these for a show I have coming up. I know, I&#8217;m becoming that pretentious asshole I never wanted to become. Whatever, I&#8217;ll probably come up with something better like 48 hours before the show and rush around getting it done in the nick of time. <br/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0009.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0010.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0011.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0012.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/></p>
