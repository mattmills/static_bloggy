I've said it before, but it's worth repeating: hammock camping is awesome. Setup and breakdown are easy, and it's way easier on my back than sleeping on the ground. Also: starlight is awesome. 

We drove west from the state park in the morning. We were passing through this little town when we saw a little band of locals out in front of a what looked like a little house; they waved, we waved, and about two seconds later we were turning around to see what was going on. Turns out the house was a museum, and the locals gatherd were there for their weekly saturday morning get together. There were home made doughnuts and coffee, and everybody was sitting around telling stories. The museum had a ton of antiques, things found out in the desert, fossils, etc. The old couple running the place had just celebrated their 64th wedding anniversary.

From there, we drove to Clayton, NM. had a delicious meal at the rabbit ear cafe (real green chili!) after going intentionally the wrong way for a minute. Then we high-tailed it to the interstate, and drove on the rest of the way. Another good day.
