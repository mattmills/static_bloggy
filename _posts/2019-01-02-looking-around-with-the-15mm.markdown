Yeah, I know, I haven't posted in two months. Some things happened, and I was a bit distracted from blogging for a while. Things just keep on happening, as they say, but it's no longer a satisfactory excuse for neglecting the blog. The backlog continues to grow, since no matter what I do, I'm still always shooting. So, here's the top of the backlog, as it is.

I have some more from Japan in the pipeline, but I'm going to save those for a bit; I'd like to make some improvements to my slideshow before I do any more posts with more than 10 images. I'm also thinking of changing the format of these a bit, so every post is a slideshow (this is mostly about improving page load time so you don't have to wait forever or only have 4 posts on a page).

May also get some repeats from my Insta; as I've said over there repeatedly, they make you do weird crops, and strongly favor verticals. The upside to this is that it's gotten me looking for and shooting verticals; the downside is I still hate cropping after the fact. Many strong images it doesn't hurt too much, but it doesn't feel right.

Now I have to go pass out.
