so, I'm chillin in the airport, and waiting on a flight. By the way, fuck all the politicians. I'm on my way to the city that care forgot, otherwise known as New Orleans. I don't know what to expect. That's the best reason I know to go anywhere: it's impossible to get an idea of some places with out going there. The truth of the situation can only be grasped from ground level. Too many stories over too much time, too much mental clutter. I hate to say it but average reporting is a pale gray thing next to the vital lived experience of a place.we'll see. More as it happens.
