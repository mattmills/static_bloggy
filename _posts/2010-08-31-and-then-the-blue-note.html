<p>Since it&#8217;s 6am, and I&#8217;m awake, I might as well blog these pictures. I lied, there&#8217;s one more post of drunk people, at Che&#8217;s birthday party. But they&#8217;re very well done drunk people.</p>
<p>Grammatical aside: does it annoy the hell out of anyone else when someone refers a blog post as just a &#8216;blog&#8217;? Blog isn&#8217;t just a post, it&#8217;s the collective noun for all those posts. Get it right, people.</p>
<p>And because I&#8217;m really bad about leaving tabs open and not hitting publish, it&#8217;s no longer 6am. At least my left arm is working right again. It was all weak earlier because someone slept on it wrong. Not sayin&#8217; who, that&#8217;d be ungentlemanly.</p>
