Fog and gray and dark. I've been shooting more lately, socially, sort of the way I used to. I'm dicsovering my camera is absolute shit in those sitations I used to love; slow auto focus, slow to wake up, just slow. I was going to replace it soon, but it seems it'll be a few more months. At least my car is paid off, so I can save pretty quickly.

For all the people that only follow this blog, and might have been wondering, I'm still here. Still kickin'. Trying to post more frequently. The backlog is still there, waiting. The projects are going, slowly. We'll see.
