This wasn't the last LK2 retro, but it kind of feels like it was. It's certainly the most memorable. We walked all the way to the Beergarden in Hayes Valley, talked about wat was going on, drank beer and ate pretzels. Somewhere, someone has a timelapse taken from the fence of the whole thing.

(This has been another Matt Mills zen story, with no real point.)
