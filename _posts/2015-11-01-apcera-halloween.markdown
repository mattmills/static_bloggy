Technically, this was Friday before halloween, but it was a good time to party. They had a costume contest, and good food, sweets. Then those of us that live in the east bay headed over to Cato's for some beers and late dinner. 7-10 of us crowded around a table talking and drinking and eating tatchos (natchos, but tater tots instead of chips). Good times.

I still have photos from Bali that I need to post, and some other stuff cooking. There are SO MANY THINGS I'm working on right now it's not even funny. There's the writing machine, there's v4.whatever of the watch, there's the novel in progress, there's the photos I'm always taking, there's work, there's the motorcycle and probably half a dozen things I'm forgetting because those are the five in the forefront of my mind.

Thinking about getting a photo printer, so I can make some prints again. I signed up for a photo workshop, and I need to have a small portfolio to take to that. I can't exactly hand the guy my tablet and say "Here's my blog." I may farm out the printing for that to somewhere in NY. Some of the black and white work from recent months, maybe. Have to decide soon. Like tomorrow, probably. Tempting to just take a copy of Cycle, but that was 6 years ago now (I can't believe the last time I did a photo book was 6 years ago). Maybe I'll do another book in that really gritty cheap photocopied style again. That was fun.
