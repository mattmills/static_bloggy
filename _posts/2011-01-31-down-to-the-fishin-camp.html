<p>So we drove down to Cocodrie, which is the middle of nowhere, reaching out towards the gulf of mexico. Even the middle of nowhere has trash pickup these days. That&#8217;s america for ya. The birds were nice, flying to roost somewhere at sunset, and the sunset was pretty awesome, too. Nice to get away from it all for a minute. Which was the point of the trip, come to think of it.</p>
