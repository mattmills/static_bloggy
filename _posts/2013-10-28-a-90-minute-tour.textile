Somewhere in there, (10 days after the fourth, according to the pictures' metadata), we took the _Jackpot_ out for a cruise around Treasure Island. For the first half, I rode out on the bow, and took photos, and then for the second, I went to the back, because I didn't want to fall in. 

I'm used to the ferry, which is a really big catamaran; two hulls means they're more stable, and a much bigger boat also means the same. This was... a bit different. Not bad, but bouncing up and down 3-4 feet over every wave and getting splashed with seawater a lot. My nikon got a workout that day, and so did my free arm, holding on to the railing.
