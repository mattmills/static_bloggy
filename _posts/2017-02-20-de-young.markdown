mobile posting again. i might fill this in with descriptions later --matt

LATER: so, coming back the next day to fill in some details... my friend Christa is in town, just to see the sights and hang out with people (if you follow me on the social, you know this). I got sick friday night with some quick-acting flu-like sickness, but was feeling better by saturday evening, and wanted to get some time before the end of her trip. 

The art inside the de Young is kind of boring. There are a few galleries worth seeking out, containing both interesting contemporary work and historical works from the 20th century, but the collections from before 1900 focus on things that just don't do it for me. I should say that my visit was brief and I didn't have time for the pre-colombian wing. Even with that, the whole collection suffered from this sort of colonial gaze (which I'm sure is a thing, now that I type it out loud). the work I liked the most was the least gaze-y. 

No, the best thing about the de Young was the space itself. The sculpture garden is world-class, and the view from the top of the tower is also very impressive. And from the outside, it's worth seeing in person as well. There's a reason I take pictures of it almost every time I bike by it.
