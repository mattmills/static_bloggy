I can't talk about "that thing that happened today":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Boston_Marathon_bombings. I wasn't there, don't know anything other than what I've heard, and even though it's from real news sources, it's still not terribly reliable. I can give my condolences to the families, and tell you that my thoughts are with them, however little that means. 

What I would like to do, instead, is put a little good out into the world. So here: a very fun morning several months ago. This is the Gospel Brunch at the Boom, where two queens make fun of the audience and we all laugh at ourselves. Not pictured: me up on stage, "although that did happen":http://photounrelated.com/2013/03/17/the-boom.html (that's Sophia's blog, of course).
