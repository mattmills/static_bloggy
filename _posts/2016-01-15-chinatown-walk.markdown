description: "It's open season on tourists"
---

I work about ten minutes' walk from columbus av., which forms a border between the two neighborhoods. Lunchtime, friday, I decided to go on a bit of a walk, take some pictures. It's a rich vein, one of those places you could make a decent essay just walking around, taking in surface impressions for a couple weeks. There's a whole project to be done just on the tourists, but I'm not sure I have the fortitude to be around them for that long. On the other hand, they're fair game.

It's taken me a while to realize how close I am to the heart of the city here. It's not a specific location, but an idea. The great confusion that happens on the borders of the different districts (at least where that border isn't a freeway dead zone). The long evolution of local places and spaces. There's a subject for you.
