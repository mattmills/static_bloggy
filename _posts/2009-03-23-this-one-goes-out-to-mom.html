Yeah, sure, sappy, I know. Go fuck yourself. My mom is in the hospital for the 13th time since September. Or was it August? I can't remember when she started dialysis, but it was around then. 3 A.V. fistulas, a peritoneal port, 6 cardiac caths, a couple infections, surgeries to install and remove the above, time for monitoring, recovering, etc, etc. She's been through a lot. And she's still not done, although it now seems that they've got a handle on why the fistulas keep failing so consistently, it's a 2% of the population kind of problem. Now she's going to rest for a couple months and they're going to do something different for a dialysis access. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >She might murder me for posting this, but oh well, at least then I won't have to worry about my student loans. This was right before they took her back for surgery today.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mom/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
