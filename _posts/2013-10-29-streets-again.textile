I did warn you. I was thinking about how if you really want to do something, do it every day, and how I should be writing more, even if it is just a few sentences. Remember when every other post was a whole essay? When I had strong opinions about selling out? Hey past me, income is nice, but don't trade it for adventures.

Things to write abotu: my wonderful wife, who makes me want to hurry home... the hella fast bike I built... ("srsly":https://twitter.com/photomattmills/status/395365967791804416/photo/1) I dunno. Startup culture, and how fucked up it can be, but also how great it can be. Looking at old photos and finding gems. Looking at new photos, and the process of going from hating everything to loving a few of them enough to show the world (This delay has helped me a bit with that). Parentheticals, and how often is too often (right here).

Yeah, time to sleep. See you all ma√±ana.
