What can I say about this meal? It was a year from the date I proposed to Sophia, and we both wanted to do something special. We couldn't have picked a better venue. The Ahwahnee is a magical place, where they roast ribeyes to perfection, and can tell you exactly the right wine to have with your meal. It may have been the several hours of hiking talking, but the food was nothing short of amazing. The space was huge and well laid out; a sort of classic hunting lodge turned fancypants restaurant.

Of course, the best space and food on earth can be boring if you're there alone; I was buoyed further by the good company of my wife, of course, and also our travelling companions, Demetrius and Christine. They were the ones who guided us around all day, and who'd thought of the dinner in the first place. A really special evening with great folks. If that's not the highlight of the trip, I don't know what is.
