So I forgot to post these- edited them, output jpegs, and then forgot to actually upload and blog them. I thought I did, sorry I lied to you cody. My fault. Anyway, these suffer a little bit from being shot at insanely high ISO on a small format camera, so don't judge too harshly. On a related note, I can't wait to get my new camera and really get to shooting again. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
