I forget what we were there for, but I was really just playing with my new camera while Sophie did the shopping. I know some people say "she does it better than me" as an excuse to make their signifigant other do the dishes or whatever, but Sophie is a fucking hawk in the grocery store. I amble around, trying samples and picking up random things that look good (and put them down in the wrong place). She has a list, and a path, and she has everything in a basket by the time I get to the meat counter for my chorizo. And then she ambles through the store with me, while I remember to get tortillas and forget the bread again.
