Yes, all of this really happened. It was a magic night, where we were determined to rage even if nobody around was really into the party. Hit like 4 bars, including the Hilo, which was lame and slow on a thursday, and then went back to KJ's for the afterparty, where KJ painted flowers and gave me good advice. I think we were up till like 5? I don't know how that happened. But it did.
