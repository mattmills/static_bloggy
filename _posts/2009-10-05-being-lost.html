Yesterday or the day before, sunday, anyway, I was driving down the highway and I had this sudden feeling of disconnectedness, of being lost. Like when in the night you wake up and don't know where you are. <br /><br />I was coming around a curve, and it was raining, cloudy, but I know that section of road, have driven it many times. There's the normal state of having been somewhere, and you remember, for example, that the bathroom is behind you and your car is out in the parking lot or driveway, and that the roads that led you there also lead to home. It's a grounded feeling, a feeling that lets you ignore parts of the landscape that aren't normal. <br /><br />For a brief second, coming around that curve, it was like all those connections, where I was going and where I was coming from, and everything that I knew the location of, all of that was cut off, and it was as if I was floating above it. It's so odd because I normally have a very good sense of the space I'm in and what is around me. <br /><br />Then, I looked around I saw every detail of everything, blades of grass and tree branches, and the cars a quarter mile back, and the shapes of the clouds, and then, gradually, over a period of ten seconds, the feeling faded, and while I didn't feel really normal for a couple minutes, the hyper-awareness was gone and the highway was just highway, and the sky was just sky, and the weirdness went away, just like it does when you turn on the light in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Anyway, now back to your regularly scheduled blog. There's some nice pics from plaza fest and outtakes from the naked sun shoot coming up, so stay tuned.
