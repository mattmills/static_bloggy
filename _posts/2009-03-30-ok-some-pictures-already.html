It was a nice uneventful weekend... well, things happened, but it was fun and nobody got hurt this time, which is to say no fights, trips to the hospital, supergluing of wounds, etc. So all of the things that have defined my weekends of partying didn't happen. Just drinking, followed by sobering up in some chill spot (thanks to the bike cave and the schofield house, respectively, for their hospitality). Anyway, photos:<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Matty at HiLo- yes, that's a plastic tiara on his head.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" >Tanner, at the bike cave, concentrating on some Texas hold 'em. I passed out like a narcoleptic on valium.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" >Andria, while she was getting me shitfaced on sunday afternoon. Jager is still a good time though.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" >Bartender, chatting. This was moments after she was showing off her tongue's lack of connective tissue. I like this picture better though.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" >Trinity and her beau, forgotten his name. She was saying something about me taking pictures at monster's ball. </span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" >Rainstorms, tonight. Hope tomorrow is nice, I've got work to do.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I'll only add to these that three times in the past five days women have offered to pose scantily/provocatively clad for me. I'm not a skeezy dude, they asked me, but it's kinda funny. What change in my complete lack of game caused all this? More as it develops. (oh yeah, and bike polo post soon).
