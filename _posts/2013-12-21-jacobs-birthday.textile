Getting out there was an adventure. We waited to get on the Bay Bridge for 2 hours. I have no idea why, but for some reason, everyone was trying to get to SF. So, by the time we got to Pacifica, it was fairly late and most of the festivities had died down. I was just a dozen or so folks, sitting around a fire pit, playing banjo or bongos or bells, singing, drinking still more homebrew. There was also (unpictured) a dessert made of apples, with cinnamon, sugar, then grilled, which was amazeballs.  A really nice night.
