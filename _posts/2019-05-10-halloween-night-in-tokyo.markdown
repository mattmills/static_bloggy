So this is a little bit later that night, going to the big square in Shibuya. We didn't really get to see it that night; the whole place was cordoned and under police control after riots earlier in the evening. The funny thing was: there could have been a riot across the street and I don't thing we'd have been able to tell the difference. Just a bazillion bodies jammed in next to each other.
