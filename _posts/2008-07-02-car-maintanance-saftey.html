Rule #13: Never place your hand or fingers or any part of your body between any metal fittings or components. Use a tool instead. Click <a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0701-1.jpg">here</a> to see why. (Warning: Kinda Gross).<br /><br />After that, after dressing the wound, after putting in the new part, the car is still jumping into 1st gear. When it fails completely, I'm getting new wheels.
