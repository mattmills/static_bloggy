title: the fisheye is a gimmick

I've been thinking about this a lot, and I'm pretty much over the fisheye. It really doesn't have that much utility for image making. It has one look, and it does that all the time. There's definitely a place for instagram-like pictures, but it's not coming out of the SLR. After these, there are a couple more in the queue, but I'm retiring the fish officially.
