This is one of the different veins I'm exploring: how we move around, how we get places, the shapes and structures and devices that enable it. This is one of those sets of work that needs to be made 60 inches wide, needs to be seen writ large. It may end up that way, or I may never get anything else done on it ever. 

I say 'exploring' but really, I'm just taking pictures of things without much conscious discretion, letting my subconscious guide the work. A photographic version of automatic drawing, if you will.
