This was some weeks ago now, even though I worked up the photos that evening. It's a lovely place to spend an afternoon. Kawan is the artist who did all the work in the pictures. He's also the subject of the last picture, and just really kind and generous. His studio is his house, and he just opened it up and shared all his rad art books and art with whoever happened to drop by and see him that afternoon. Check out his [Nieman Lab predidiction](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/12/zines-had-it-right-all-along/) for media in 2018... more zines! I'm 100% behind this.
