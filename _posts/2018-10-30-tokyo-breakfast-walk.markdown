This was the moring of our transit day to tokyo; all those blog posts were in my future, but you don't get very far without coffee when jet-lagged, so we went to a nearby cafe that Sophia had bird-dogged and I had just a really lovely pastry and americano. It was situated on a small river, which you can see in the second and third photos.

Oh, and: the little marker (second to last photo): No idea what these are, but I see them around buildings. Best guess: some kind of property line or survey marker.
