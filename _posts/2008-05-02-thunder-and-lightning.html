I'm typing this up from the handheld, watching a movie. It's a little weird, but it'll do.<br /><br />I've been thinking about my photography, about how I tend to be blurry a lot. The thing is, I'm constantly trying to not be blurry. Fast lenses, fast ISO, steady hands. The problem is life is blurry sometiems, it moves very fast, is fleeting, never stops.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />There was a storm today, looked like it might produce a tornado right over my house. There I am in the miiddle of the road, takng pictures, mom yelling at me to come inside. So, after watching for another minute, I did. The truth is though that I would have stayed out there and watched the storm. There wasn't any real danger, just hailstones. The tornadoes all touched down a mile east of here, really small ones. We did get some pretty big hail though. and then another storm in the night.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />It's funny how things work out sometimes. I really wanted to write a post earlier today about how excellent and wonderful girls can be sometimes, even while they're exasperating, but the energy's all gon out of me. maybe later. but things are good, the house is still here, and I'm still talking to everyone. Gestalt is going to happen, even if we only have five pieces in our first issue.
