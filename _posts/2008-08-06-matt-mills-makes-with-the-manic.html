so, I'm bored. Not just a little bored, but epically madly stuck in a rut bored. Normally what I do when this happens is, well, something crazy, I take a trip or cut off my hair or have some brilliant idea and go off after it for a while. All of my options right now fall into two categories: the "I don't want to" and the "I really shouldn't."<br /><br />What I should do is edit the 7000 pictures I've shot since coming back here into some kind of portfolio. That's what I call a good start.
