And two days ago was my first thunder game. Have I mentioned, lately, how awesome my girlfriend is? Because she got us corporate box seats. Easily the swankiest way to see a basketball game-- that ish was catered from the start and at halftime there was a desert cart that came by. I didn't take the long lens, so no great pictures of anything, but it was a great game, right up till the last minute where we lost. Refs were blind, we shoulda gotten foul shots in those final seconds. 

Unrelated: I saw a pretty car that day, too.
