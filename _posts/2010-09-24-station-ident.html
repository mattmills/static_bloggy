<p>over on warren ellis&#8217; <a href="http://warrenellis.com">blog</a>, he does these, and well, I&#8217;m just doing this one so that those of you who follow me in cyberspace only (and who haven&#8217;t heard from me since I got back) that I&#8217;m alive and well. Egypt was cut short because of some illness requiring a brief hospitalization, after which I was right as rain, but which completely drained my funds, destroying the fine balance I had between making money and spending it. So I had to come back early. I also now owe my mother a fortune, even though she says I don&#8217;t. there will be state fair pictures soon, and plans are hatching for more adventures.</p>
