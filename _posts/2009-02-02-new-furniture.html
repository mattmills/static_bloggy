title: New Furniture...

So I got a new couch today, courtesy of Grant (hi grant). The best way to get me to clean is to move furniture, and/or get new furniture. Something about rearranging everything makes me want to organize all my crap and throw away all the various detritus I collect over time. So, after sleeping through the super bowl, I started to work. <br /><br />The room actually seemed to get worse for the first couple hours, so I paused, laid on the new loveseat and listened to tom waits, which for some reason motivated me. <span >Nighthawks at the Diner</span> for anyone who cares. <br /><br />I don't throw away all of my junk; I'm enough of a romantic that some stuff I keep around for sentimental value alone. I have bits and pieces of most of the cameras I've owned over the years for example. The ones that weren't stolen, that is. Certain pictures, too, I just can't part with or throw away prints of, even if they're a little damaged. The tech stuff I'm pretty good about trashing once it's past its prime. So, because it's such a rare occurrence, I give you my room, as clean as it gets:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/clean_room.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Also yesterday, I had my first gig with Take Two productions, and let me say it's nice to work with professionals. I was running the wider of the two video cameras, something I've never done before (all my video experience has been single-camera work, documentary, and as cheap as possible). It took me a few numbers, but I got the hang of it. It didn't help that I was on an hour and a half of sleep; I probably would have been a bit quicker on the uptake, a little smoother, if I had been able to sleep saturday night. Or at night at all; It's 5am and my super nap ended around 9pm. <br /><br />Anyway, I might end up preferring to run video on these gigs, given that I get more work from take 2; there's less pressure. We'll see. I haven't done stills for them yet, and I'd like to try that too; It's more in my bones to do stills. This site isn't "videographermattmills" for a reason. Anyway, my newly clean and cleared bed is calling my name.
