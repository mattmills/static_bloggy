So right before we all left for the plaza district, another photographer that was there took some of the girls out to shoot, and I sort of butted in and shot a few things too. Couldn't help myself. Anyway, good photos. Now I have a chore to take care of. Don't tell anyone, but I'm making little 4x6 prints of the actual fashion show to give to the girls and or their stylists.
