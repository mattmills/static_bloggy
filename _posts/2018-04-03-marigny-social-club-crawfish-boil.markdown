Still in March of last year now. We'll take a jump forward soon, I swear. Anyway, these are from my friend Caleb's semi-annual crawfish boil, that goes under his Marigny Social Club banner. Fucker can cook, is what I'm sayin. I only made it for the very last pot (and took the last beer too) because I'm an idiot and decided to take public transit to get there, got lost in the park and took almost an hour to get from the muni station to the actual location of the boil. Everything was delicious, and I seem to remember getting a ride back to the east bay. good times.
