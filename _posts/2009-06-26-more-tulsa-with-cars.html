SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY... was when I took these. Sunday morning, mostly, although the car show was in the afternoon. i really wasn't that impressed visually with the cars... i liked their style, I thought the work was impressive, but visually to me cars are just a big dead thing in the frame. If I'd been reporting on the car show, I would have picked out little details, but as it was I was just walking around with Rachel and Gretchen, all of us trying not to die in the heat. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0005.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0006.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0007.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0008.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Coming soon (after I take a nap to kill the hangover): The skate sessions.
