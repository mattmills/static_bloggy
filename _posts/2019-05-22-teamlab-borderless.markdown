Projections and lights and mirrors. Interactive, sometimes. I can't say it was a place made for instagram, in the vein of the Museum of Ice Cream, since it was kind of difficult to photograph in all that dark, projector filled space. Still, neat. I can tell that the place was designed so that you really had to see what the creators wanted you to see.

Anyway. Working on trying to find financing to buy another Leica. Shooting with it doesn't endear me to it, but working on these files sure does. I don't know how, exactly, to make this work, because consumer financing at the point of sale has ridiculous interest rates; highway robbery by another name. If I had a business entity, it's possible I could lease it, and that's a bit more reasonable. Might look into that a bit more.
