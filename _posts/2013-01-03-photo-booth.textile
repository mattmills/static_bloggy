So, the weekend after I got back into town, my friend "Tim":http://timpromptu.com was having his birthday party... I won't mention his ages, just that it was incremented to an even decade. I did a photo booth type thing, without the walls or curtain. The decoration is all Katie's doing... basically I either stood there and hit the button, or used the intervalometer, or sometimes had Sophie take pictures; it was very improvisational. 

On-camera flash was used; there's something a little crisp and glaring you need for a proper photo-booth shot. I'd have used a ring light if I had one. Very fun night, and doesn't my lady look punk rock?
