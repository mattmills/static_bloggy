title: "sam's club and the electric cart"

I've never before actually needed to ride in one, but they say there's a first for everything. Today, I used one of those electric carts to get around sams. FYI, they're a pain when you have to use them. That and for some reason I kept getting dirty looks; I guess because I have the brace on under my shirt people thought I was a healthy person abusing the cart, if that were possible. Oh well.
