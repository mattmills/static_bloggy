This was one of those days where the fun just doesn't want to stop. Everybody just kept deciding to keep going, order another round, get another bite to eat, move on together to the next location. There may have been a split to nap in the mid-afternoon, but we all rallied at Temescal Brewing after. There may have been some cycling after beers, who can say. By the end, by the last picture, it was dark and time to go home and chill. Luckily, it's downhill from there to the house.
