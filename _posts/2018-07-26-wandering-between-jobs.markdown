description: "some pictures for yr eyes"

So I didn't actually end up with a ton of free time between jobs; there was a lot of stuff I needed to get done in that week and a half. But I did have one day where all I did was just walk around and take photos. This was the first part of that day. I'm not sure why the month-old roll took so long to get processed, but it did. 

The second and third church photos are actually mosaics of two pictures. Color film is still very hard to get the color right. 

I have some idea of what I need to do to complete the San Pablo project; what it's about, at least to me. I did a big edit of the photos and I got a feel for what was working. I'm not sure if I want to proceed with the project on film or keep it in digital. There's something to be said for consistency, and that's one thing this project never has. It _is_ mostly shot on a digital of some description. Maybe I'll continue in that vein. 

I know this is a little disconnected and rambly. I'm all over the place right now, keeping all the plates spinning. Winter is the time to recharge; right now, we go full steam. Onward!
