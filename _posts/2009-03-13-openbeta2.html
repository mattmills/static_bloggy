Last night was openbeta, and it was actually a really cool interesting event. I'm not just saying that, you know; a lot of talks and conferences bore the shit out of me, and I just leave in the middle of them. OK, so I stepped out for a smoke in the middle of one of the boring lightning talks, but other than that, it was good.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />This is Grant, giving his demo of Twircl, which still hasn't launched, but is by far the coolest thing I've seen one of my friends come up with since art school. Twircl is a direct group messaging app that runs on top of twitter, something that the system  needs.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />These are the wimgo girls, and, well, do I really need to say anything. Thanks for the pen, ladies.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Grant kills 'em with his presentation:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Voltron Presents: Why they're awesome. I need to find out if they have any staff photographer openings. Maybe they need a screwball wandering correspondent for their web side? Y/Y?<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />The view from OKCCoCo:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Afterparty:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There was a good reason for these faces, but I can't remember for the life of me why.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
