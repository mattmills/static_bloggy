These ared just more semi-random street pictures. The first two are probabably destined to be part of the ongoing "MacArthur" project, should it ever take more than a vague form. The rest are from the neighborhood around the office. I'm guilty of taking #4 something like 50% of the time I walk on that side of the road, although they're all somewhat different, due to foreground, lighting, composition, etc.

I've been thinking a lot about motivation. How do I keep going? So far, it's been enough  to keep pushing the button and putting the photos up here. There's some external validation, when I post photos of people and they like them, that helps a lot. But really, I don't know. It's an open question.
