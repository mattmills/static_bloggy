Today was a good day in paradise. Started out sleeping in a bit, then went to brunch/coffee/movie with Lori:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />The brunch we were going to go to (the guatemalan on classen) is closed sundays, or at least it was closed today, so we went to cafe do brasil, where I got my chorizo fix over eggs and a side of Mimosa. Coffee at coffeeslingers, mostly to kill time, and then onto the movie, Taken, which was awesome- the most realistic fight scenes I can recall in a movie. Brutal, fast paced, and it could've ended about five minutes before it did. No need to sugar coat the ending, Hollywood. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Then, with Lori off to study something boring, I was free to go shoot golden hour on 23rd street. I had to go around twice to get the photo of the capitol. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />These same people are always hanging out on that bench in the corner. I don't know if they live in the apartments out of frame to the left or they're homeless and that's just their spot. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Homage to Eugene Atget. Wig shop. It was always a little but of a surprise to hit the end of a roll so quickly; about half an hour walking and 141 pictures. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />So, I walked from Robinson to Classen, dropped off the four rolls I'd shot at Walgreens, and went to grab a bite while they were being run. I have my doubts about the usability of these photo cd scans; fine for web, but I'm going to need to scan them better to make prints. Might just not bother next time and scan everything at home. Then again it does make blogging a lot easier.
