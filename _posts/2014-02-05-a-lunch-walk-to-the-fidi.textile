Startup central may be SOMA, but the finantial District is seeing a huge boom of its own. There's a group of folks from work that almost always go for salads at an undisclosed location in that area (nobody wants to advertise). I'm not a salad eater by any stretch, but I do like the walk, and the light of all the giant glass building is nice. 

There's something to these photos, a complexity, that I really like. They have a lot going on. I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about subject. Specifically, what my subject is. What do I want to be looking at. It seems a lot of the most interesting things are already covered, in depth, by geniuses, sometimes many times over, in the face of change. I'm not sure where I was going with this paragraph. You can stop reading now.
