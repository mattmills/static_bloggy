I've decided part of working through this backlog, since it's gotten so big, will be cutting images a lot more than I have been. That's not to say that things aren't still going to be super random here for a bit, but there will be less of it.

I've figured out a direction for PROJECT SAN PABLO. The thing that's missing is the thing that animates any long term reportage: people. I mean, there are lots of traces and things, but the people that make San Pablo actually interesting are who I need to get after. I was thinking something like a survey of all the independent businesses on the street, from the piano dealer to the Dead Fish. That could be really interesting, and it would give it a focus that it didn't have before. Even inside that, I may have to be somewhat selective; it's 22 miles of road, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it is.

I should probably start with a list of businesses, huh? Or maybe I drive up and down and write down names of places. There's no database where I can type in street and 'not a chain' and get a decent answer, is there? Hmm.

I'm also thinking about picking up another electronics project, maybe a laptop or another watch. I feel like I might be able to scratch the laptop-specific itch by just buying a GPD pocket or iPad pro. Not sure. Watches are hard, though too; a lot more constraint on power and space. So I dunno. So far I've downloaded datasheets for a system on module for the laptop, decided that 8gb of ram might just be enough, and drawn a little diagram in my notebook. The idea being something that is really portable, but with a good mechanical keyboard, in the vein of the Tandy 100, or more recently the [MNT Reform](https://mntmn.com/reform/). They're using the i.MX6 processor, the same one in the [Novena](https://www.kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=Novena_Main_Page). It's well supported on mainline kernels, but I want something newer and faster, so I'm looking at the i.MX8.

Anyway, enough babbling. More tomorrow, if time permits.
