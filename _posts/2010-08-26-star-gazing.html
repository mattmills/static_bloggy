<p>You wouldn&#8217;t think there would be photos from an adventure out to lake Arcadia to see the Perseid meteor shower, but then you aren&#8217;t me. It all started at Heather&#8217;s going away party. There were a few drinks (though not a lot, not by a damn sight) and somebody mentioned it, and then the next thing you know five of us were cramming into Heather&#8217;s car (after dumping some of her jut-packed things into the back yard) and pushing off.</p>

<p>Moments after I took that, I had this impulse to stick my head out the window, to try to get a clearer picture of the road. Of course my hat was instantly blown off, so we had to go back and get it. Heather found it. Holly found a frisbee. Then we got back on the road, and got there without too many problems (although I was the only person who had a flashlight).</p>

The meteors, it seemed, hadn&#8217;t gotten the memo. Only a few of them came.</p>

<p>That didn&#8217;t matter though. We all saw a few, although we didn&#8217;t all see the same ones. There were wonderful moments whenever a couple of us would see the same one and say &#8220;There&#8217;s one!&#8221; at the same time. Also, not pictured: the four moons of Jupiter that we could see through Holly&#8217;s binoculars. Finally, I have to brag a little: that picture, the one below? Taken with only starlight. <span class="caps">BOO</span>-<span class="caps">YAH</span>.</p>
