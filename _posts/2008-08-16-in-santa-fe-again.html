Alex is doing really well, considering the extent of his injury; broken pelvis and a cracked rib to boot would lay anybody up for a few days. Kit on the other hand, is just phenomenal. First of all, she seems about ten times hotter than when I last saw her, is taking care of Alex's every need, setting up a place for him to live and a way to get there and dealing with all the details of wrapping up his Santa Fe life. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0002.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0002.jpg" ></a><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0003.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0003.jpg" ></a><br />I'm doing little things, like driving, and craigs-listing the truck, but mostly I think I'm here to help everyone keep their shit together and lose it under the stress. I don't know how many times I've told Kit to breathe and "It'll be ok, we'll get it sorted," etc. And then there are the secret missions that i can't really talk about because they're secret and Alex reads this sometimes. You'll enjoy it Al, I swear. <br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0004.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0004.jpg" ></a><br />That's about it here so far. Catch you all later.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0005.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0005.jpg" ></a>
