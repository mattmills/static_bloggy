With these pictures, and a lot of the work I've been doing recently, the serious pictures, as opposed to the stuff that I see type work, I was looking for a certain kind of light, a mood, a suggestion of possibilities. It looks, to me, like some of the Crewdson I remember liking in the early oughts. Only, I'm not using the production budget of a middling music video, with a small army of crew to make it happen. I'm just taking advantage of the fact that both Oakland and SF have changed their lighting to LEDs, which are a nice white light, and exploring that space. It's dark and mostly empty, but that's bound to change.
