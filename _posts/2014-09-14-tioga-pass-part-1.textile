So, over labor day weekend, I went on a nice little road trip out to death valley and back. To make things interesting, I decided to go out through Yosemite. There's a road to the north of the main valley, Route 120, which goes to Mono Lake. I'm breaking this up into smaller bits so I can process the photos slow enough to do a good job, and not take 6 months to come up with a one post edit. This isn't a magazine.

I took these photos from an overlook called "The Rim of the World," where there was a very large fire last year. Hundreds of thousands of acres on fire. It was pretty unreal. There are hapier pictures coming, lakes and mountains and desert, but I had to start somewhere.
