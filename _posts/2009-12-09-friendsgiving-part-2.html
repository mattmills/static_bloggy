Some good discussion over on my facebook with Kris Kanaly re: that last post where I said the oughts sucked in a lot of ways. If you can read it you should, I don't feel like re-hashing a lot of stuff here. A note on the nature of this blog: I post the photos for other people to see, and I write stuff for myself. It's always rough and nothing I say here is ever final or complete. Also: I didn't mean that there was nothing good happening anywhere, just that only a few pieces of art (and by art I mean writing, painting , photography, and any creative endeavour) were what I'd call transformative, that stick with you, that change you, that have a lasting effect. Then I realized, on reflection, that a small number of works like that might be normal. Not that the worlds sucks, but you don't make the mona lisa every day, either. A fault, but I think the rest of the argument stands- reducing noise and increasing good signal is a good thing. Anyway, on with the photos. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Apples to apples, which is an excellent idea while drunk, even though I lost a lot.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Fixing the flag. also: Permanent Distress would be a good name for a punk band.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Hot ass.
