So, a couple of weeks ago I got the chance to attend a dinner by chef Muffie Fulton, in collaboration with Kathryn Tomajan of Fat Gold. This is not a review; both of the geniuses behind [Fat Gold](http://fat.gold) are friends, and besides, I'm not qualified to judge food like this. It was an evening of molecular gastronomy, in which all the things I thought I knew were turned upside down and all the food was surprising and kind of amazing. Liquid Nitrogen! Blow torches! Sous Vide! 

I wasn't super happy with the photos from this evening, to be honest. I wish I had another dozen, and good pictures of every course; I just wasn't "on" that night. Oh well, at least there are some pictures.

<span class="caption">Making the chocolate bits that went into the desert. You mix chocolate, coconut oil, and liquid nitrogen, and stir. to collect, you pour everything through a strainer. All that's left is the bits of chocolate. Very flashy, and the liquid nitrogen is gone before it gets to the floor.</span>

<span class="caption">Ice cream making. The liquid nitrogen isn't just flash in this case; it freezes the cream almost instantly, not allowing the water time to form large crystals. This makes the result as creamy as it can possibly be.</span>
