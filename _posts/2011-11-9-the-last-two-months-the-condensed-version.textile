So the last two or three months have been a bit of a blur. I turned 27, found a spectacular woman, got situated in my new job, took three trips of a week each (two to san fransisco and one to mexico), decided to start shooting film again, drank, ate, and told stories, and generally lived it up. 

There are some photos of all this. They are coming soon, I promise.
