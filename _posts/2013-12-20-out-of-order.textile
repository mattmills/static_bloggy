I'm not sure if these photos are out of order or not, It may have been one of those weeks wehe I did two rides to the beach. I know there's a racoon in the fourth one. I really like the gas station, for the shape of the awning and the apartments in the background. I know there's cold brew, waiting for me to decant it.
