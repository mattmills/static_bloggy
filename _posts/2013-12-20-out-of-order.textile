I'm not sure if these photos are out of order or not, It may have been one of those weeks wehe I did two rides to the beach. I know there's a racoon in the fourth one. I really like the gas station, for the shape of the awning and the apartments in the background. I know there's cold brew, waiting for me to decant it. 

Edit to add: thing I forgot to talk about because no coffee when I wrote this. The feeling of bombing down market street at night, right into the heart of the city, weaving in and out of traffic. The best. (As I've said before, all the parts of that ride are the best).
