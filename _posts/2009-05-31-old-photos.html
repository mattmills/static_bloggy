since I've had to resort to shooting film, I had to get it processed, and there was this random roll that has been on my printer stand for a while, so I had it done as well. These are from the end of spring 2006, at the annual Doc Studies barbecue. Looking at this old work, I couldn't help but notice how different it is, and how much higher a percentage of misses I had back then, even with the same camera & lens.  <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Two of the graduating seniors.</span><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Professors standing around.

I'm going to leave it as an exercise for the reader to make up what happened between us. I can tell you it won't be as interesting as what actually happened.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
