Like I said, some pictures that weren't even possible before; the fourth one, especially. Incredible speed, and incredible sensitivity in this camera. I love it.

The next edit, I promise, is all people. People are way more interesting than scenery. Also: I shot them in a dimly lit bar, which was doubly fun.
