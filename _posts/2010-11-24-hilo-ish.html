<p>photos from the hilo. this is why i&#8217;ll never be upper management, and also why I don&#8217;t care about ever being upper anything. the new job is nice though; I&#8217;m working with good people, and doing interesting things, or at least they&#8217;re interesting to me, which is what matters. And I think I&#8217;ve got scheduling posts sorted for this thing, so that&#8217;s good too, look for about one a day.</p>
