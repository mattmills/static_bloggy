<p>So, after compiling the list the other day, I realized there were a few things I left off, and some details I left out. First of all, the towel. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day#Origin">A Towel is very important</a>. Normally, I would take a backpacker&#8217;s towel, which are made out of this microfiber super absorbent material, is smaller than a regular towel, and dries faster. For this trip, I&#8217;m using a shamwow, which is the same material as the more expensive backpacker&#8217;s towels, but cheaper and available everywhere.</p>
<p>The laptop: it kills me to say this, but packing light isn&#8217;t everything. I&#8217;m taking the big one.</p>
<p>Not pictured, but packed: A water filter, which was strongly recommended to me. We&#8217;ll see if I really need it.</p>
<p>And two more things, especially for travel anywhere with mosquitos: A <a href="http://www.sawyerproducts.com/B6B.htm">sawyer extractor</a>, and a bottle of 100% <span class="caps">DEET</span>. The extractor is for use on any kind of bug bite, sting, or even snake bite. The do wonders for itching bites, anyway. The <span class="caps">DEET</span> is to keep from getting bitten when I&#8217;m in an area with a lot of bugs. It works.</p>
<p>And this is what it all looks like:</p>
