This is the last of the pics from last weekend. Man, that was epic. I'm basically doing two jobs, but only getting paid for one; I'm a lowly barista, and I'm a photographer, shooting all the time and editing when I can, around my social and work schedule. It's actually pretty fun, I just don't sleep a lot these days. Never did sleep much though. <br /><br />That morning, though, I woke up and felt fine; six whole hours of sleep does wonders, even when there's half a bottle of rum involved. then we did brunch at Cafe do Brasil. They really have the best sunday brunch, and my favorite chorizo in town. Then onto sauced to hang out on the patio and soak up the sun on a gorgeous day. A fantastic end to a really great weekend. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Chelsea stretching. I love the lines in this one; odd parallels you don't expect take a second to resolve. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0038.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Again with Chelsea.
