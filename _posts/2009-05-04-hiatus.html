Sorry for the hiatus. I've been stupid and self-doubting or maybe smart and self doubting. And I've been sick. Anyway, while my hard drive is restoring from backup, I thought I'd share a few of the week's lesser failures. Actually, looking at the pix, they're not that bad. Lighting in clubs is just impossible unless you bring your own. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I shot these all last wednesday, at Kamp's deli. It turns into the latest and greatest OKC dance club on wednesday nights. It might be there more often, but I really don't know. It was actually really fun, there was a good spread of music and a good spread of people. Lots of photographers, although I was the only one not using flash. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I'm not leaving out the captions out of laziness or unremembered details, but I really think these don't need anything to explain them.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
