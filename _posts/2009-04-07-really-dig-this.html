<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/goekler03242009.html">The most dangerous person in the world.</a> You, you scary motherfucker. Quote:<br /><blockquote>Security itself is an illusion. It is a perception that exists only between our ears. No army, insurance policy, hazmat team, video surveillance or explosive sniffer can protect us from our own immune system, a well-intentioned but clumsy surgeon, failing to look before crossing the street, an asteroid randomly hurtling through space or someone willing to die in order to do others harm.</blockquote>
