I think I may have posted one or more of these to insta, but here they are in my space, processed (a little) on my machine. I was in denver for Elixirdaze, a conference about elixir in a place where there's legal weed. Get it? Daze? Anyway, I got out a little while I was there, saw some things, ran an elixirbridge, etc. Sophie came, and I didn't get a single good photo of her. Ah well.
