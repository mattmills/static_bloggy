So, jumping forward a few weeks, to just after the [last japan post](https://matt.pictures/2018/11/07/fushimi-inari-shrine.html). There was a bunch of stuff that happened that mid-day, including wandering around a mall looking for food, and I'm pretty sure there was a nap, and then we went for a second night walk. We may have found some whiskey. I know we did, later in Tokyo, but that's getting out of order, something we obviously don't do here.

The second and third images are black and white because color balance is hard, especially from lightbulb brands one is not used to, in mixed conditions. Lots of fluorescents mixed indiscriminately with CFL and LED lights. Oh well.
