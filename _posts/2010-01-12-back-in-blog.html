Yeah, i had another one of those lulls. Always happens. NYE and the surrounding weeks found me unable to drink without getting massive hangovers and as usual, some depression, which wasn't helped by my inability to shoot photos, so the whole thing kind of spiraled downwards so much so that I don't want to be the man with the camera anymore. This is what I feared the most when I took the programming job; by filling my head with something else, there isn't room for the photography. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Look at this hipster.</span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Of course, we all know that's bullshit. I'm as much a photographer as I was then, and this is just a temporary setback. I'm gonna get my chops back, by hook or by crook, and all will be well with the world. And for the record, I have taken a few good photos, just not as many as I'd like. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Before the freakin' blizzard, or maybe after.
