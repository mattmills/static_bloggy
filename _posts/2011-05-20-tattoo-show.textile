randomly went to the tattoo convention, thinking I was there to see this band I keep missing (and who just changed lead singers for some reason, I dunno), and anyway, I had a pretty interesting conversation with their guitarist, I think, about the demographic represented there. Odd and interesting. Anyway, had one good photo:
