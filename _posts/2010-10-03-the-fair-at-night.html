<p>The first pic isn&#8217;t from the fair, but it&#8217;s only fair to put it in, because she got me in. As in Mckenzie bought my ticket. The fair at night isn&#8217;t much different than the fair during the day, except that the crackhead-looking carnies are actually on crack, and not just fiending. There&#8217;s another post from my daytime runs at the fair coming up, too. As soon as I finish with those photos, that is&#8230;</p>
