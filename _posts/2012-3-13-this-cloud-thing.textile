Maybe not in a bad way? It seems like even when I'm taking pictures of people, I'm really looking at the far background. 

In other news, I may have another kidney infection. Since the last one landed me in a hospital in Egypt for three days, I'm being pretty cautious about this one, going to the doc this afternoon, pushing fluids (including that perennial favorite, cranberry juice).
