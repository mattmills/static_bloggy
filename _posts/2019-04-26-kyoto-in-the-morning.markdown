I'm not naturally a morning person, but something about crossing the dateline made me much more of one, at least for the first week. Even after being out relatively late the night before, we were up super early and got ourselves together to go back to Tokyo. A little walk, some cutesy bikes, and a coffee shop that catered to tourist enough that they served a really good scrambled egg. Don't ask me to remember the name, although I could probably find it on google maps.

I've encountered two opposing ideas recently; that of choosing a project that's doable, on the one hand, but on the other, giving yourself permission to stretch out. The former was on Patreon, [David Alan Harvey's page](https://www.patreon.com/davidalanharvey/posts); he was talking about his work that was keeping him close to home. The other was in Craig Mod's newsletter [Ridgeline #16](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/016/), the bit about Robert Caro. He worked for 5 years, thinking that was a lot, and then met fellow writers that had been working, seriously, for much longer, which made him realize it was totally fine to be where he was doing what he was doing. The lack of outward progress wasn't an indicator of failure. Some things are not incrementally successful.

Which tells me that maybe I'm wrong about PROJECT SAN PABLO. It's not a code name, I just like it in all caps. There's something to be said for chipping away at something for many years. It's not done. It won't be done for a while. It's yet to be seen if it's 'doable' but it's something that I can do other things and still have as a going concern, a subprocess, maybe.

Also I bought a new lens. We'll see how I feel about it. Review images coming sometime in 2022 at this rate.
