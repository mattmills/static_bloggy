Because we didn't have any wedding celebration planned here in SF, and because we've accumulated some friends here, we decided we needed to do smoething with them to celebrate the then upcoming nuptials. Karaoke was the natural choice. The only other thing I need to say is that I missed a couple members of the party, because they were sitting next to me; Demetrius and Christine, sorry about that.
