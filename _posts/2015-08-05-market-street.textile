Ah, market street north of third: the real heart of the city, beating with activity. I love this part of town the most; it's the most inhospitible to sanity but also the most alive place in the whole city. You get a sense of the scale of the place here, like no other. This is somewhat experimental, as I edited the photos on my phone. I may hate it and delete it later.
