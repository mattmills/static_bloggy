Last blurry fisheye post, I swear. I do love those flags though. Er, well, the photos of them. As symbols, some days yes and some days no. Things like "this":http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ln9aa10UAg1qzqlvro1_500.png make me wonder. But anyway, it's friday, and it's already a good day. Saw the sunrise and took pictures of clouds. Not a bad way to start your day.
