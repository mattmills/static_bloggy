<p>So, after the last plane landed, I got myself through customs with no hitches. The visa was a piece of cake, just pay the man, get your sticker, and move on. I looked like what I am, a tourist/backpacker, and customs doesn&#8217;t give a fuck about guys like me. This is probably wise on their part.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m sort of wandering around, and a taxi driver approaches me, wants Â£80 to drive me into the city. I&#8217;m like, no way, there&#8217;s a bus that&#8217;ll get me there for way less. He tries to tell me there is no bus from the airport, yada yada, but I get on a shuttle and get to the airport bus terminal just fine. At this point I&#8217;m feeling quite good about myself and take some notes to the effect of &#8220;You&#8217;re not an idiot.&#8221; And then I waited an hour for a bus that I never saw, and shared a cab into the city with some other backpackers. I tried to get the cabbie to take me to an <span class="caps">ATM</span>, as my funds were low, but he didn&#8217;t understand. This is a recurring theme: English is useless here. Or nearly. So he dropped us off at the Cairo Museum, which was closed (probably for ramadan), and the other backpackers covered me. We wandered a bit in search of an <span class="caps">ATM</span>, no luck, so said our goodbyes and split off our separate ways.</p>
<p>Thus began one of the great trudges of my life, in search of my hostel. I walked one way, and then another, and then a third. Then I ran into some British people with a guidebook, who told me how to get to Ramses Square, which is very close to where I&#8217;m staying, and so I set off walking. Unfortunately, what they said would be a 20 minute walk took the better part of 2 hours. There&#8217;s nothing quite like the self doubt you get when walking alone with a heavy pack in a foreign city, with no map and only a vague idea of where you&#8217;re going. So, I finally get to the square, and I can&#8217;t for the life of me find the street I&#8217;m supposed to go down to get to the hostel.</p>
<p>So I call my mom, shout some (this is the loudest city in the world), mom gets on google to try and help. I&#8217;m trying to figure out where I am, exactly, because I&#8217;m not sure after all the walking and the self doubt. So I walk down one road for a little while, find a hotel with a sign in english, and she does directions from there to my hostel, and kinda directs me. I&#8217;m on the phone with her, and she&#8217;s talking me through getting there, when this guy comes up to me and asks me in english, &#8220;Can I help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>So I show him the address of the hostel, and he knows the way, and we start walking. I never for a moment doubted this man; I could tell he wasn&#8217;t a con man or tout. Just a man, doing something good. Along the way, he shows me a blob on his hand that at one time was a cross. &#8220;I&#8217;m christian,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;Coptic?&#8221; I ask. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. And then I get up to the hostel, and there was showering and sleeping, and then wandering in search of food.</p>
