So, back when I was trying to start a city blog for okc, and at the same time still blogging here and doing my best imitation of a fish's drinking habits, I had a series that would have been titled "I love it here"- reviews of good shit here in OKC that would have been a regular feature if the blog had had more than three readers. Shows you how good I am at promotion. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >The inside of the place is nicely decorated, with good seating.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bigtruck/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I had a couple steak al carbon tacos, a mexican coke, and chips and salsa. The tacos were good, not too greasy, with corn tortillas and onions for flavor. About that flavor: I wish I could say it was on par with other places I've had tacos locally, (I'm looking at you, Iguana, with all your deliciousness) but there just wasn't enough. All I got was beef and onion, no spice. That said, they were good, and with the salsa, not bad at all. The chips and salsa were chips and salsa, good and fresh. A word on Mexican Coke: you should try it. They use real cane sugar to make it, which has a better flavor than high fructose bullshit. Really better than what you get out of the fountain. I think I paid 9 bucks for the meal, and I was pretty satisfied when I was done. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Any place with patio seating is a win in this town.

They're a locally owned newish place, right in the middle of the part of 23rd street that I was betting would see development 6 months ago... and here we are, already a new restaurant. And they're good. Great patio seating, nice atmos inside, fast service, friendly staff, and that awesome location,  they've got all the stuff they need lined up to be a success. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Not a food photographer. But doesn't this look good? Needs more seasoning to be perfect, though.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bigtruck/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Definitely recommended, and you'll probably see me there trying out more menu items as the weeks progress.
