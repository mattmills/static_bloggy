These guys were really, really rad. My friend MKB invited us out, got us on the list. His cousin is the guitarist/keyboard/melodica player (plus more besides). I would have paid to get in, and I almost bought a t-shirt, but I think I was either out of cash or too drunk at the end of the night. I do remember stopping to get a gatorade before ubering home.
