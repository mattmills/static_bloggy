My friends are sort of scattered, not just in the head, but geographically. All over the US and in several countries abroad as well. So I'm always stoked to see one of them come through my neck of the woods. 

Sarah is one of those friends with whom distance and time don't matter; A hug and a beer and then we're back on bikes, as if no time had passed since we'd last seen each other. Ben, her Londoner boyfriend, came along, and with Sophie rounding out a quartet, we had a grand time catching up.
