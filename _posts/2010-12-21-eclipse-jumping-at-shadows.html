<p>So I knew if I didn&#8217;t get this up now it&#8217;d be after new years before I got to it. I had to improvise a tripod out of duct tape and a light stand. If you click on it, you can see it even bigger. I might have to make some prints of this one&#8230; have to get an ink cartridge first though. hrm. I had lots of clever things to say that I though of while I was outside shooting this but now they&#8217;ve all left my head and I need rest. See you guys in the morning.</p>
