Basically last sunday was one of the best days I've ever had, right up there with my 20th birthday, the day I graduated high school, and the field day at summer arts' institute. Might even be the best, what with all the excellent madness and amazing people and things. <br /><br />I woke up and went home, had a good breakfast with the family, eggs, home fries, bacon, the kind of meal you dream of later. Then I coordinated with Chelsea and Meaghan for the shoot later that day (don't cheat, there's tons of story before we get to those pictures). We were going to go to Stillwater and make a big production, but Maeghan had cut her foot badly the night before. She didn't want to cancel, so I suggested we scale back, just do one of the ideas and do it here in the city. So we did, and chelsea came down and met us at Sauced. Cyrus showed up on his motorbike (dubbed the aluminum falcon because it's also a piece of crap) and said hello and whatnot, and then jetted, and so did we. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />We found a place to do the painting, over at Grant (<a href="http://twitter.com/schofield">@schofield</a>) and Damaris' (<a href="http://twitter.com/somna">@somna</a>) house, but they weren't going to be home, so we went in search of coffee, and failed. What we did find, Sara Sara, was downright creepy. But their cupcakes were decent and the milk bar was brilliant. They need to work on their coffee offerings though. Real espresso would be nice.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then I waited, while Maeghan did the work and Chelsea sat very still. This is what the waiting was like: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Now add to that 20 mosquito bites, and I decided to go inside to wait. This is what the girls were up to:<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And later: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And finally, on location, swatting a bee: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And the final silhouette: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0021.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There's another picture up at <a href="http://thenakedsun.com">The Naked Sun</a> our literary journal. That's right, I said "our"- I'm one of the editors and web designer, and if everybody is half as cool as then seem, and can manage to meet deadlines, we're going to be the raddest thing out there. <br /><br />From the shoot, we dropped Maeghan off to go get her foot checked out, and headed to Norman for cake and more adventures. Tune in in a coupla hours, and there'll be more pics.
