So, I found the rest of the Tokyo pictures. Turns out a bunch of stuff that I'd already blogged was still in LR mobile, and for some reason I thought it was sorted wrong. So, yesterday's post was actually from the end of the backlog, not that it matters here and now, 6 months after the fact.

These are, as far as I can remember, from getting drinks one night in the accidentally fancy hotel. Booking online sometimes works out in your favor, is all I'm saying. I think we were paying something like $125 a night? Nice room, came with a local cell phone even.
