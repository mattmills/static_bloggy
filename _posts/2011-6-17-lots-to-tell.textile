I just pushed the better part of a month's photos up to the server, and there's a whole metric fuckton (bigger than a standard fuckton, you know) of stories to tell. Some of which I can't tell, because a gentleman doesn't.

You all know neighbor Traci? Love neighbor Traci (that's an order). She's one of the friends that I'm fantastically lucky to have around. This was at the other room about a month ago, some random saturday. So a bunch of us were drinking, and somebody pulls out these fake glasses. You can't tell because of the light, but they're those yellow-tinted lenses. And Traci is just goofing off, being her usual silly self.
