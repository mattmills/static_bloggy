title: I should be working on the blook
date: 2009-01-26

And applying for jobs and trying my hardest to come up with the zillions of dollars I owe some silly people who think they're ever going to get any money out of me. As I'm pretty sure I'm never going to get any money out of me, what chance have they got?<br /><br />Anyway, there is a final final edit of pics for the blook, just under fifty pictures, and they're in a sort-of order, so I'm going to mock that shit up and print it off and see what people say. <br /><br />In other news, some lame pictures for your ass:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nothing/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nothing/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />yes, super boring, because the last week was all shot to hell between being in the hospital with my mom's multiple operations and my stomach flu. Isn't the dog cute though? I promise to get out more and take photos this week. Now, page design!
