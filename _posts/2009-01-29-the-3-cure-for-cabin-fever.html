yesterday, after far too long inside the house, I drove downtown for three dollar burgers at Mcnellie's with a bunch of people. Ended up being nine or ten of us, crowded around a table for 7, but it was good. Delicious food and friends and some photos were just what the doctor ordered. <br /><br />In other news, I think I'm going to spend the better part of tonight folding paper. The maquette is printed, I just have to fold everything and sew it together. Oh yeah, and cut up the last few photos. Speaking of photos:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" />
