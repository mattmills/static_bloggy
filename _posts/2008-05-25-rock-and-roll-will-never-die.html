because there's dudes out there keepin it real, reality being important as it's all we have. That's not true, we have imagination too, angels have wings because they take themselves lightly, so we must do the same if we hope to fly. I'm rambling drunk if you can't tell.<br /><br />Just took a nice ride over to Sauced, the bike and dog friendly hippyish pizza place just north of 23rd. Good pizza, ran into some kids, one who I think I knew from somewhere, but unfortunately he was an asshole and wouldn't talk to me. He happened to have photos, but they were terribly cliche, super white girl in black underwear with a gas mask, black and white, you know, art school special. but then this other dude turned out to be cool, rides fixed gear, works in a shop here, knows the scene pretty well. appearently there are a couple bike gangs. Who knew? Alleycat next week too. So that'll be fun. <br /><br />Let's see. Had some work stuff which I'm not going to talk about, because unfortunately, my job has some confidentiality required. But it was handled quickly and efficiently once I went over to my bosses house, the man has connections, and I'll leave it at that. Lucky for all of us, and I have a feeling it would have been me taking shit for it if he hadn't worked it out. Then again, he got to know all the people he knows by being a really nice guy, so who knows?<br /><br />Looking forward to going to the paseo arts fest tomorrow. I'll probably bike over. It's another day in paradise, and I get to sleep in. Peace.
