Hopefully I can be forgiven for sandwiching these photos of some friends I ran into at the concert in between band posts... these are cool people, as far as I know. I mean, I'm not their mother, so I can't be a character witness, but at least they knew where the cool show was in stillwater that night and made it out, so that says something. And some of them, the ones I know better, are verified badass. So, guilt by association with me:<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/concertfriends/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/concertfriends/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/concertfriends/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
