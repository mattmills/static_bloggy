For most people this isn't news. If you're someone in the far future reading this, if it's somehow survived without any of the social media to give it context: I'm madly in love with this woman, and I'm really glad that she puts up with me. That day, I got up and drove to lawton with two of my best friends in the world, one who was officiating and one who was going to be "best man" even though she wasn't a man. Sophie's aunt and uncle provided a venue for us; they have a lovely house of their own design, and a beautiful garden out back. 

I said some really sappy, meaningful things that I'd struggled to write the night before, got a little choked up, and she made up her vows on the spot. Tim said some great stuff that I don't remember, and we were pronounced husband and wife. Then there was drinking and mingling, and cake cutting. The whole thing was perfect.
