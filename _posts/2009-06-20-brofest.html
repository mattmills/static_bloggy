These pictures are all from the raddest ride kickoff/fundraiser ever. Stuart, Pat and Cameron are heading across the country on the <a href="http://broquest.com/">Broquest</a> (link goes to their site). This is why film sucks sometimes; I'm just now getting the pics from their out of town party up and they're already three states into their Portland to Portland run. Oh well.<br /><br />The Dudes of America played, and they're a bunch of rockstars. I'm too lazy to caption, you can figure it out. That and I'm blogging while flying down the highway. wah-hoo.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0007.jpg" alt="Photos" />
