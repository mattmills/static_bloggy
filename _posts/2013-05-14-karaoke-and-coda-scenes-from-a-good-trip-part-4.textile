Put two of my support colleagues in a room together, away from their homes, and there will be drinking. Put three of them together and there will be at least one story to come out of it. Put them all together in one place and there will be karaoke. Add an open bar, and you'll get the supreme moment of the trip, wherein Tim Littlemore gave the most epic rendition of "Sweet Child of Mine" ever. 

The next day was rough. Hangovers all around. Sleep on the bus home.
