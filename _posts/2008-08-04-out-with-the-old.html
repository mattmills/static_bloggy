So sunday I finally gave up my old car for an even older car. My Mercury Sable has been with me for about three years, four or five girlfriends (I can never keep count) 60,000 miles, and a lot of good and bad times. Some of the bad times were when I had to piece it back together after it failed me, but that's only happened a few times; it's been remarkably reliable in the clutch. <br /><br />So this post goes out to all the miles and all the memories.
