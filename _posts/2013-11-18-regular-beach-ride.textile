As the winter makes the days shorter, my rides ended closer and closer to sunset, and then I'd arrive at the beach at sunset, and then finally, the last couple times, it's been dark when I got there. This was somewhere in the middle of all that, near dark with the fog rolled in. Just fantastic. Can you tell I'm looking forward to getting back?
