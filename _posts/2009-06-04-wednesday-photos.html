This is sort of a test post, I'm mucking about with the stylesheet. I'm also writing some essays for the photobook I've been trying to do since january. Wednesday was a success though, in that I got out and had a good time. And I took some photos. The style might not be right, but I'm working on it. <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/bbwt/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/bbwt/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/bbwt/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://photomattmills.com/images/bbwt/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
