I don't know if it's me, or what, but I always seem to find myself in these beautiful places. Everything sort of falls together, and then I take a picture. What is my subject? Is it the everyday? Is it me, being a crazy person? Is it the world, not making any sense? If there ewre a feeling I was trying to convey, maybe it would be that moment of realizing how lost youare, and looking around to get your bearings.

It's probably none of that. I have been drinking. There was wine, and then there was whiskey... well, at least tomorrow is Thursday.
