So this was, what, a month and a half ago? Long enough, anyway, that I feel bad for taking this long to get to the pictures. They've been in my loose edit folder since the plane ride home, and have just sat there this whole time.

Magmaconf is this wild conference that happens sort of semi-regularly in the town of Manzanillo, on the western coast of Mexico, in the state of Colima. It's a language and even tech-agnostic conference; the two times I've been, and spoken, were both about my hardware adventures, and not about software. Somehow, the group that gets together there is always really remarkable. Not just people that are brilliant at what they do, and I mean the audience as well as the speakers, but really friendly.

The conference organizers do as much as they can to foster that environment, with really amazing events and surprises; The mariachi band on the last day, after the last talk, was a complete surprise. I think the luchadores were planned, but the spontaneous mock weddings were a surprise. I'm pretty sure this was the last incarnation of Magma, and I'm glad I was there.

So, in roughly chronological order, here are the photos.

<span class="caption">this was the AirBnB I stayed at the first couple days. I sat and worked on my talk for 12 hours on the balcony of the room. And I still wasn't done! I finished it the morning of, sitting in the audience, being rude.</span>

<span class="caption">The venue, on the left, was a local University. Beautiful area, all volcanic soil and dense forest.</span>

<span class="caption">To open the proceedings, there were native dancers, local to the area. The idea being that so many times, you go to foreign locales and all you see is the conference venue and don't get any of the culture; this was the first of several moments where the culture was put front and center.</span>

<span class="caption">Beach Games. This was after everyone had met and eaten and drank together; a capital-e Experience.</span>

<span class="caption">One of the famous things in Manzanillo: this giant fish sculpture. Which is funny, because it's not a fishing hub, but Mexico's largest container port.</span>

<span class="caption">The aforementioned mock wedding, this was one of several. The audience had fun picking odd couples out (the 'couples', by the look of it, were also having fun)</span>

<span class="caption">Pinata Action.</span>

<span class="caption">Along with the Mariachi band, there was a group of dancers. Really entertaining to watch; all of the dances told stories. </span>

<span class="caption">The male half of the dance troupe. It was quite elaborate, with costume changes between dances and props and intricate choreography.</span>

<span class="caption">The first set of luchadores. There were three different bouts, with a fourth between amateurs from the audience.</span>
