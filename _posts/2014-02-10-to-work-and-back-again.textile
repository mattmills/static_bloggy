My commute includes about 100 yards of walking down market street. It is, as my friend Mike says, 'Prime people watchin'. My tendency when taking pictures is to look for something about to happen, and try to get there in time. On this stretch of road, everything is always happening. Deals are made, breakfast is bought, people wander, lost, across the street at 9am on a Thursday. Tourists gater around their maps, and locals weave around them, as if they were statues. Bums beg for change, and they get some, sometimes. Messengers lock and unlock their bikes, delivery trucks stop with days or weeks of supplies for the buildings and restaurants. All in 100 yards!
