I haven't been posting. I have a shit ton of photos, and they're all uploaded now, so my only excuse is that I'm usually pretty tired of the computer at the end of the day and don't have the energy to write a whole lot or stare at the screen for an extra hour or two to put something together. <br /><br />Anyway, these rae from the beginning photo class I taught at OKCCoCo - I only had four people show up, so it was a little bit of a letdown, but at least I was able to answer some questions and maybe the people learned some things. I said a lot, I know that much.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/november/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/november/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://photomattmills.com/images/november/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
