<p>There would be more of these, but I didn&#8217;t much feel like taking pictures. Wasn&#8217;t totally together. I was sad and not really functioning so well. But the ride helped, and the funeral (minus the pastors that didn&#8217;t really know adam) was good. The ride after, without the police escort, was better. We took over the street, up broadway and down 23rd, a critical mass like this city hasn&#8217;t seen in a while. It was kinda epic, which fitted with what I was feeling at the time. Maybe you had to be there. <br/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0019.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0020.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://photomattmills.com/images/moremay/0021.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br/></p>
