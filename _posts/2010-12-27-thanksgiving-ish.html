<p>For some reason, I&#8217;m still a month behind, although I am slowly but surely catching up. Sarah, a couple days after thanksgiving, invited me to her family&#8217;s late-giving, which they&#8217;d delayed so she could make it. It was nice, and then the next day we went to friendsgiving, which I didn&#8217;t really take pictures of because I was too busy stuffing my face.</p>
