so, this was a hell of an epic brunch. Back when the thunder was still playing, I think. I find myself in picasso's most sundays, because a) they're close, and b) they're awesome. It's the kind of place you can meet a girl for the first time to kick off something amazing (photos to come on that one), meet your friends hungover, or take your mom for mother's day. I've done all that in the past month there. It's always a good time. This one was especially good, what with the thunder win and the pretty girls and plentiful mimosas. The epitome of a Picasso's brunch.
