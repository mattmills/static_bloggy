<p>Speaking of the city, I was riding around the other day, and had another one of those moments, where I saw something that caught me. I took this photo:</p>

<p>Something about the combination of being in a big space (the structures always have that effect on me; I realize how much sky there is up there) and all the activity of construction made the growth the city is experiencing real to me. Like before, it was politicians talking about it, people bitching about it never going to happen, and here we are. It could be nice. Let&#8217;s make it nice.</p>
