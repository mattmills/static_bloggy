<p>well, I opened this tab yesterday, and the dream I was going to write about has pretty much evaporated from my memory. Oh well. The first photo is from elemental, at there new shop, the first morning they were open&#8230; it was sort of beautiful how thin their operation was, and how well it worked. There was one woman with a square reader taking credit cards, and one barista making amazing espresso drinks. It&#8217;s gottena bit better now, even&#8230; I think they have heat in their building, and some more furniture. Really exciting to see a new business start up an do so well.</p>
<p>the rest of the photos are the usual fare, from a night out at blue note.</p>
