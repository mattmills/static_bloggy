This was the home opener. Somehow, I find myself at a baseball game about once every other year. I like the idea of baseball, and the games are fun to go to, but I can't get into watching them on TV. It's just a rare treat. I think this was like May-ish; the film stuff is all out of order, and this roll didn't get developed with the rest.
