<p>I&#8217;ve been volunteering at the <a href="http://scissortailokc.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Scissortail social space</a> the last couple weeks, helping out with their bike shop- it&#8217;s all pay as you can/free. If you&#8217;re having bike problems, come by wednesday after 2, and I&#8217;ll be glad to help. I mean, look at that truing stand.

They also have a decent-sized lending library, lots of good books that I have a feeling are hard to find in the MLS libraries. So come hang out, have some coffee (if we have any) and fix yo&#8217; bike. It&#8217;s just south of the corner of 30th and walker, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;q=3012+N.+Walker+Oklahoma+City,+OK&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=3012+N+Walker+Ave,+Oklahoma+City,+Oklahoma,+73103&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=o0jTS8r1OcT_lgel_rjsDA&amp;ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA&amp;ll=35.500107,-97.521622&amp;spn=0.008044,0.012767&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.500164,-97.521014&amp;panoid=HTWxLowF16IFz1QCax8YGA&amp;cbp=12,102.31,,0,-5.13" target="_blank">right here</a>, next to the AA Food Mart.</p>
