since I've told this about twenty times today, and a lot of those tellings were under the influence of strong drugs, i figure one more time won't hurt.<br /><br />i was riding into town on 4th street and a car t-boned me. my lights were on, and i'd bet money they weren't looking. paramedics said the car was pretty messed up too.
