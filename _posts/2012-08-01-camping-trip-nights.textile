I think this was before the fourth, but don't quote me. There's been a lot of beer and quite a few miles since then. This was a good time, getting to know some new folks, and seeing some old friends as well. Hammock camping is awesome; I was set up and ready to go in like 15 minutes, and down and ready to leave in 5. 

Things to remember not in the photos: getting stuck going up the hill coming into camp, the place we stopped at was the _shortest_, everything tastes good cooked over a fire, and be sure to wear sunscreen. There is a second post, with the day photos, coming up next.
