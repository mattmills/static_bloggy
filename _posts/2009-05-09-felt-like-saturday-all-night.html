For a dude like me, who doesn't have normal, that means it was extra special. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >A little taste of ISO 25,000. THIS IS HOW REAL MEN TAKE PICTURES.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />(edit out long drawn out account of room cleaning, wheel building, and finally bike tube acquisition, which was crazy to do, but after writing it out, boring to tell). <br /><br /><span class="caption" >These two old dudes were just sitting togetther mooning over each other in a loud bar filled with people a third their age. Aww.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then there was booze cruise and Sauced and Hi lo, and hanging out at Erin/Colby's place, with some random Cmay thrown in just because my night wasn't interesting enough already. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >People always do this. Not usually in triplicate, though.<br /></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />On a random somewhat tangentially related note (but who wants boring details?) I realized last night that I like philosophies that allow me to do nothing and reap benefits for it. That's all. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Bike ride?
