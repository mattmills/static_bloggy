So, not to say that the office is boring; it's infinitely better than sitting alone at home working remotely, but it is a little short on visually interesting human interaction. Also, I _work_ in the office, so I'm not nearly as prone to taking photos there. I'm much more likely to have my camera while we're going for a coffee in the afternoon, or walking to lunch or whatever. 

Also, as a rule, if more than three people are in a candid photo, at least one of them will be making a slightly awkward face. Oh well.
