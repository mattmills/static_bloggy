description: "some pictures for yr eyes"

These are all from last summer, June and July, when my mom was here, and not. I'd just gotten the Fuji, and was super excited to shoot with it. I put 10 or 12 rolls of film through it, and had them souped at a local lab, SF Photoworks. Then, because their scanning prices are just silly, I bought a scanner and started scanning them all in myself. I may have said this before, but I really like the images I get out of this camera. I really don't like the process of scanning images. The epson software sucks and is slow; the film holders are fiddly and kinda shitty.

I'm not sure I'll keep going in this vein. It's possible. The newer cameras are a lot easier, which isn't always a good thing. I see my primary job is to tell stories with the camera; take pictures that at least tell a little part of a story. Sometimes it's just setting the mood; sometimes it's something really explicit. Sometimes, it's telling a joke. The determining factor in this work (among others) is paying attention to what's happening. Sometimes, if the pictures are easy, I forget and just shoot a bunch without thinking, without knowing what I'm getting.

I feel kind of off when I'm doing this, and the main way to break out of it is to change what I'm doing. Change lenses, exposure modes, put my hat on backwards. Tricks and superstition, maybe, but also things that work to get my head back in the viewfinder. Anyway, the limitations of the camera, the fact that it only has 10 exposures on a roll, is fully manual, and large, and slow, actually help push the mental state. It's like stretching before a run.
