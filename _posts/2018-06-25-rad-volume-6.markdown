This was the second one of these I went to, and the first one I've taken any pictures at (that I recall; the last one was last november). It was just this incredible, engaged group that was gathered to talk about art that was happening in the media right then; Childish Gambino's _This is America_ had just dropped, as had _Dirty Computer_ and one other thing I can't remember; I think most people talked about the first two. Good discussion, but you really had to be there.

There's always a theme, and the theme is different every time; the [upcoming salon](https://www.facebook.com/events/224692748320411/) is on wellness. I might talk about book making, and how putting them together is a sort of therapy for me; a way to tie things up at the end of a project.

Speaking of projects: it feels like PROJECT SAN PABLO is coming to a close. I need to get some things scanned, and work on some editing, and then I'll probably do a zine with the results.
