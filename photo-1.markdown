So, modern cameras are sort of amazing. A lot of the tecnical burden of picture making is completely gone. All the worrying about shutter speed and f/stops, just gone. It can help to know about them, but we're not banging rocks together any more. There are some things to be aware of: there are things you set once and never have to mess with, and then there are things you change as conditions change. 

Most cameras, when you get them, will have a setup phase, which will ask you to set the time, timezone, and date. Then you'll need to make the most important decision: raw or JPEG. This is the kind of file the camera records. Like every technical thing ever, the correct answer depends on the situation. If you're never going to do any post processing at all, then JPEG makes more sense. It is a smaller file, and literally every computer made since the turn of the century can read them. BUT. The smaller file means that you're throwing away some information. Which is why, if you're going to do any post processing at all, you should shoot raw. Most computers have a built in program that can read raw files these days, and there are some good free ones, such as darktable. I use lightroom, from adobe, which costs $10/month but makes my life so much easier. Now that we've decided that, there are some other things to set and forget. 

Focus mode: I do the dumbest mode the camera has, and leave it on the center AF point. On my nikons, that's 'single servo' mode, and on canons, it's 'one shot' mode. Other modes are worth learning if you're shooting college level and above sports, or wildlife, but even then you can muddle through with just the basics. 

The next thing to consider is the mode dial. If you're using a pro level camera, it may not have a mode dial, or it may be a button and knob affair. Consult your manual. There are three really useful modes. Those are Aperture priority, Program, and Manual. I tend to favor A, unless I'm drunk, in which case I put it in P. So, aperture priority lets you set the aperture, and the camera adjusts the shutter speed to make the exposure work. This means you have really good control of depth of field. Program mode is similar, in that the camera will set the exposure, and you can move aperture and shutter reciprocally, but it's a little smarter. It won't let you set a combination that won't work. For example, say I was shooting inside, somewhere dark, and I had the aperture way open, to let in as much light as possible, and to get shallow depth of field. Then, I go outside for lunch, and shoot pictures on the way. If I have it in aperture mode, I have to remember to stop down, since the shutter speed only goes so high. If it's in program mode, the camera will make that adjustment for me. 

There may be other modes, but they're frustrating. They do things somewhat unpredictably, and according to the whims of an engineer half a world away from you. You're here now, and you can pay enough attention to what you're doing to not need the idiot modes. 

Manual is useful when you want the camera to do something that the meter doesn't understand, like shooting a concert, or shooting stars through a telescope. The meter in the camera only works over a certain brightness range, so the dark sky will confuse it (this has gotten better in recent years, though). Also, it takes it a moment to respond to changing light, and I find that I get better results when there's a big light show to just set it manually, look at the pictures on the back of the camera, and adjust. You need to know a bit about exposure. A longer shutter speed means more light, which means a brighter picture. A larger aperture also means more light, and also less depth of field. If you really want to learn more about exposure, go read _The Negative_, Ansel Adams. You don't need to, but it's the canonical treatment. 

Now that we have a file type, a focus mode, and an exposure mode we're almost ready to take a picture. Those three things are in order of how much you change them; never, almost never, and once a week, roughly. The last thing before you go out and shoot is to set the ISO. There's probably an auto ISO setting that's fine, but I prefer to nail it down per situation (call me old fashioned). If it's bright, like outdoors during the day, 400 is perfectly reasonable. Inside, in a well lit office, I'll turn that up to 1000, and that's about it; in bars/venues/poorly lit aquariums, I'll turn it up more. Basically when I notice the shutter speed getting too low, I turn it up. Don't forget to turn it down when you're back out in the light, because higher ISOs have more noise.
