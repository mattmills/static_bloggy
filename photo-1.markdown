So, modern cameras are sort of amazing. A lot of the tecnical burden of picture making is completely gone. All the worrying about shutter speed and f/stops, just gone. It can help to know about the technicalities, but we're not banging rocks together any more. That said, modern cameras are complex, and setting them up, knowing what to change and what to set and forget can be tricky. This, then, is a guide to settings, and how they can go wrong.

### SETUP

Most cameras, when you get them, will have a setup phase, which will ask you to set the time, timezone, and date. Then you'll need to make the most important decision: raw or JPEG. This is the kind of file ("file format") the camera records. Like every technical thing ever, the correct answer depends on the situation. If you're never going to do any post processing at all, then JPEG makes more sense. It is a smaller file, and literally every computer made since the turn of the century can read them; they are universally compatible. BUT. The smaller file means that you're throwing away some information. Which is why, if you're going to do any post processing at all, you should shoot raw. Most computers have a built in program that can read raw files these days, and there are some good free ones, such as [darktable](http://www.darktable.org/). I use [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html), from adobe, which costs $10/month but makes my life so much easier. Now that we've decided that, there are some other things to set and forget.

### Focus Mode

I use the dumbest mode the camera has, and leave it on the center autofocus (AF) point. On my nikons, that's 'single servo' mode, and on canons, it's 'one shot' mode. Other modes are worth learning if you're shooting college level and above sports, or wildlife, but even then you can muddle through with just the basics.

### Shooting Mode Dial

The next thing to consider is the mode dial. If you're using a pro level camera, it may not have a mode dial, or it may be a button and knob affair. Consult your manual. There are three really useful modes: Aperture Priority, Program, and Manual. I tend to favor Aperture, unless I'm drunk or lazy, in which case I put it in Program. Aperture Priority lets you set the aperture, and the camera adjusts the shutter speed reciprocally to make the exposure work. This means you have really good control of depth of field.

Program mode is similar, in that the camera will set the exposure, and you can move aperture and shutter reciprocally, but it's a little smarter. It won't let you set a combination that won't work. For example, say I was shooting inside, somewhere dark, and I had the aperture way open, to let in as much light as possible, and to get shallow depth of field. Then, I go outside for lunch, and shoot pictures on the way. If I have it in aperture mode, I have to remember to stop down, since the shutter speed only goes so high. If it's in program mode, the camera will make that adjustment for me.

Manual is useful when you want the camera to do something that the meter doesn't understand, like shooting a concert light show, fireworks, or shooting stars through a telescope. The meter in the camera only works over a certain brightness range, and the sensor only works over a certain range as well, called the dynamic range. Also, it takes it a moment to respond to changing light, and I find that I get better results when there's a big light show to just set it manually, look at the pictures on the back of the camera, and adjust. I'll talk more about exposure later.

There may be other modes, but they're frustrating. They do things somewhat unpredictably, and according to the whims of an engineer half a world away from you. You're here now, and you can pay enough attention to what you're doing to not need the idiot modes.

### ISO

Now that we have a file type, a focus mode, and an exposure mode we're almost ready to take a picture. These three things are in order of how much they change; never, almost never, and once a week, roughly. The last thing before going out and shooting pictures is to set the ISO, which is how fast the sensor reacts to light. There may be an auto ISO setting that's fine, but I prefer to nail it down per situation (call me old fashioned). If it's bright, like outdoors during the day, 400 is perfectly reasonable. Inside, in a well lit office, I'll turn the ISO up to 1000. In bars/venues/poorly lit aquariums, I'll turn it up to as much as 10,000. I just listen to the sound it makes, and if it sounds slower, it's too slow, so I turn it up.

The reason we bother to adjust is that lower ISOs give cleaner, clearer pictures, but require a lot of light, since they respond slowly. Higher ISOs have more noise, but that's worth the trade to get a high enough shutter speed.

### A word or two about exposure

I know I said that I wasn't going to go on and on about technical jargon. This isn't jargon. It's essential; it's the thing that makes photographs in the first place. First, some terms:

* Exposure Value (EV) -- is the amount of light that gets to the film.
* Shutter Speed --  the amount of time the shutter is open.
* Aperture -- is the opening in the lens, which can change size.
* ISO, as I've mentioned, is how fast the sensor responds to light.

The last three, set to one setting, give one exposure value. A stop is the unit of exposure value; one EV is one stop. Double the length of the exposure, and the EV moves up one stop. Halve it, and it goes down one stop. Apertures also have stops, but they move in multiples of 1.4. So, one stop less light than f/2 is f/2.8, and one stop less than that is 4, then 5.6, then 8, etc. ISO doubles or halves to move up or down a stop. Some examples, to illustrate:

* Outside, on a bright, sunny day. ISO 400, f/16, 1/500th of a second. If you're shooting a portrait in this light, you may not want so much depth of field (which is how big the range of focus is). So, you open up your aperture to f/4, or four stops. That means to get the same exposure (and so far, we're trusting the meter), the shutter speed will go to 1/8000th of a second; but, if your camera doesn't go that high, you can take the ISO down to the minimum. Turn that down two stops, to ISO 100, and you'll only need a shutter speed of 1/2000th, which most cameras have.  

* Inside a house, during the day. f/2 @ 1/60th of a second, ISO 400. But, people are moving around, expressions are fleeting, and 1/60th is not fast enough. So, we go up three stops of ISO to 1600, and increase our shutter speed to 1/250th, which is plenty fast.

* Outside again. Landscape time. Sunset over Yosemite Valley. 1/250th at f/8, ISO 400. But, there's an interesting foreground detail that needs to also be sharp, so stop down to f/22, three stops (8, 11, 16, 22). The shutter will go to 1/60th, which is probably fine for a static subject.

### Exceptions

There are times when the camera's exposure meter will be plain wrong. Any time the sun is in a photo, it'll be under exposed by about two stops; any time a reflection of the sun, like on a window, it'll be more like a stop and a half.
