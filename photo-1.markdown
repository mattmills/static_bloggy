title: Not Untitled Photo 101

This post is meant for people that have a camera, and ask me how to use it. Here, I'm going to reveal all the secrets to my success as a photographer. Not that there are any secrets. As a photographer, there are four things to control: composition, timing, focus, and exposure. In a studio, there may be other factors, but this isn't meant to cover studio work; also, if you're proficient with these, then the rest comes fairly naturally.

Composition is a matter of taste, and must be developed over time. I can't give you a lesson on composition, but an excellent beginning would be the archives of the [FSA](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/). Just looking at pictures and seeing how they're constructed can be a lesson in how to make them. I have a whole bookshelf of photography and art books, just for this reason. There are rules, really guidelines, that people will trumpet all the time. Really striking photos often have a surface impression of obeying one or more of these rules, but they almost never do on closer inspection. So, take all such rules with a grain of salt and don't worry about them too much. Make it look right to you. That's the real rule.

Timing, or when to take the picture. This is a matter of milliseconds. Precise timing can make or break a shot. When shooting nature, or still life, the right time may span minutes, but when shooting people, or anything that moves, it is much harder.  I cannot pass this subject without mentioning my first photographic love, [Henri Cartier-Bresson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyhMqDfmG9o). It's not just a matter of peak action, such as when a player reaches the top of a jump shot, but when the elements of the photo come together to form the right compositon to tell the story.

Focus can be automatic, and is tied to exposure, for reasons that will become clear when we talk about apertures. I'm talking here about the optical focus, and not concentration. So, the parts of the picture that are not blurred are in focus. Choose what part of the picture you want in focus, and make that happen. Many cameras come with wonderful, fast autofocus, and this is a fine thing. The only thing that is essential is that it does not interfere with actually taking the picture, either by distracting you from seeing or slowing you down. For many years, shooting film, I would switch to manual focus in low light, because I could focus faster than the camera. If you're using an SLR, this probably isn't the case, at least if it's less than 5 years old. Focus on your subject, and take the picture. Using focus for effect is an advanced technique, and left as an exercise for the reader.

Lastly, there is the complex topic of exposure. Whole books have been written on the subject, and that was before digital complicated matters. I will attempt to give a brief treatment, and then tell you how to not have to think about it most of the time. Exposure is about controlling the amount of light that reaches the sensor. There are three things here to adjust that affect the picture in different ways: there's aperture, ISO, and shutter speed.

Aperture, or f/stop, is how much light is allowed through the lens. There is an iris in almost every lens that opens and closes to adjust this. The size of this aperture divided by the focal length gives the f/stop. These are commonly written as f/2, f/2.8, f/4, etc, though cameras may omit the 'f/' for brevity. Since it's a fraction, the larger the f/stop number is, the smaller the aperture. Smaller aperture, less light. Aperture also affects depth of field, which is what the area that's in focus is called. Because of the way lenses and light interact, the light that's out of focus tends to pass through the edges of where the aperture is situated, the nodal plane. As you close the aperture, less light gets in, but also less out of focus light gets in, so that there's more of the picture in focus.  Depth of field is a deep topic by itself, but the general rule is simple: smaller aperture, more things in focus.

Shutter speed is a measure of how long the shutter is open, usually expressed as a fraction of a second: 1/500, 1/250, etc. Like apertures, these are often also shortened, so that 500, 250, and 125 are displayed. A longer shutter speed means more light hits the sensor. So, 1/500th is half as bright as 1/250th. They're one stop apart, we say. The only thing to worry about here is if the shutter speed should get too low, there may be motion blur. I say keep it above 1/125th for people moving around, and more than the focal length of your lens for still subjects without a tripod. So, for a 50mm lens, more than 1/50th of a second. If you want motion blur, that's a different essay.

There's also ISO, which is how fast the sensor responds to light (more or less; there is a bunch of technical bullshit I'm leaving out). I usually set this to the lowest setting that will get me the shutter speed and aperture combination I want. Higher settings give more noise, which is generally undesirable, although like many things that are technically bad, they can be used to great aesthetic effect.

So, all that in your head, how do you get the right exposure? There is a range of light to dark that the camera is capable of capturing, and you want to fit as much of what you're shooting into that. There's the [sunny 16 rule](https://web.archive.org/web/20050412230055/http://pinkheadedbug.com/techniques/exposure.html), but that's hard, so there are light meters in the camera to measure the light. This is great, and modern light meters are pretty good, but they do tend to fail when some part of the picture is very bright, and there's too much dynamic range for the sensor. You can fix this by dialing in exposure compensation, minus a stop or two. The best way to figure out if you've done enough is to look at the picture. You can bring up the shadows in post processing really easily.

So, the easy way out is to trust your camera. There are two modes I use most of the time on most cameras: P, for program, and A, for aperture priority. So, onto using P and A. You want to control depth of field, while keeping the shutter speed fast enough for whatever situation you're in. I'm usually shooting for max depth, out on the street, or max shutter speed, in the night, with people. Shutter speed and aperture have a reciprocal property; one stop more open of aperture is the same as one stop longer of a shutter speed; so you can increase one and decrease the other and the same amount of light hits the sensor. P lets you move both relative to each other, while keeping the scene properly exposed. The problem with this is it tends to move around as you do, so you're not always going to get a consistent aperture. Enter Aperture priority mode. It lets you set just the aperture, and the camera will try to choose an appropriate shutter speed for you. If the exposure is out of range, like when the lens is wide open and you're out in the sunlight, the camera will just set the max shutter speed. It will usually also blink or something, to tell you it's not going to work.

other modes: The green square is the idiot mode, designed to protect you from yourself. Do not be tempted by this mode, it is not for people that care about pictures. Same for the scene modes. They're dumb, you're not.

There! now you have a bunch of words to google, and maybe figure out how to take pictures. As my motorcycle instructor said, have fun with it. The good news is that even though cameras aren't cheaper than a motorcycle, they probably won't get you killed.
