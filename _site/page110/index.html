	  So I finally downloaded the card that's been in my camera for two weeks. Andrew, and if you look closely, you can see yr. humble photographer:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0001.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0001.jpg"  /></a><br />Sunset, at more or less the same time:<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0002.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0002.jpg"  /></a><br />Anne and Kit, in the mountains. These two together (or separately) are just really awesome, good company and good friends.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0003.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0003.jpg"  /></a><br /><br />Clines Corners tourist trap, where I had an early lunch.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0004.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0004.jpg"  /></a><br />And I'm still doggedly taking my camera to the supermarket. Yes, there are still more pictures to be had there.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0005.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0005.jpg"  /></a><br />And this is my current project: updating my portfolio. Hopefully by the end of the week I'll have shopped it around and have real work as a photojournalist.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0006.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0006.jpg"  /></a>

	  Yesterday I had the most exciting time mowing the grass. You know, normally I hate it, it's boring drudgery in the hot sun, but I got home about half an hour before storms were coming in. So I decided to race the storms to get the front yard mowed. there was distant lightening and darkening skies and me, running to try and get done. I made it, just as the first drops came down. <br /><br />I was all tired after that, and I wasn't going to go out, but then KW texted me (I have a feeling he bulk texted a bunch of people). But anyway, knowing people were out was enough to get me out. Beers and interesting times and new friends. I got home and I was totally exhausted, so I went to bed.<br /><br />I slept 11 hours. I was asleep for 11 hours. All at one time. I never sleep that long. I'm so used to four or five hours and exhaustion, I've go it down to an art. I feel so much better today. It's awesome. <br /><br />There will be photos eventually. As soon as I get off my lazy ass and download the card that's been in the camera since I came back from santa fe. <br /><br />Now: welding, car repair and fun times.

	  I still have a working pair of headphones. The new ones got ripped apart today. got dad his birthday gift, he liked it. What else? on the bad news list, I'm out of money, bills are due, and I'm back in oklahoma. So what else is new?

	  and other stuff, too. Arianna, and I have no idea why I got such a block about it. Actually, it could have to do with the emotional stress of the week and the madness therein. What else? I've been thinking about things to say on here and lots will occur when I'm out and about, but not a lot comes to me now. <br /><br />Definitely going to Egypt and Gaza in January. Actually, I'm only definitely going to Egypt, getting into Gaza is a matter of getting to know the right people once I'm on the ground, fining the right border guard to bribe, or a small row boat to row a few miles trough the blockade. Or any combination of the three above things. <br /><br />All of my backups are stale by a week now. If you don't know, this is a terrible thing. Although it's better than none at all, I need to run a full backup tonight. <br /><br />I bought new headphones today, both ears work, so that's good. Not much else to report. Money's low. more later if I get inspired of crazy or something.

	  Still here. Had a really excellent dinner with Mike and Tina and their lovely daughter who's name I'm drawing a complete blank on. It'll come back to me. Really good food though, I've never had a bad meal there, and the company is extraordinary. It's always a treat. Then, I had a nice talk with (insert youngest daughter's name here, which I now have a major mental block around, even though we've known each other for a few years now) after Mike and Tina went to bed. It's really rare to find someone who I can really talk to, who has interesting things to say, etc. <br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-1.jpg" ></a><br /><br />So, in other news, I got kicked out of Alex's place the other night. Well, first I did a semi-pornographic shoot with Kit, which the roommates didn't like. I can't fathom what a bunch of hetero bachelors would find objectionable about a naked woman in the house, but that's just me. The shoot itself went really well, Kit is happy with the pictures, and you should be able to see them eventually on suicidegirls.com. Yeah, that classy porn site. If such an oxymoron is beyond your ken, sorry. (As an aside, this is the only way I'll do certain kinds of photography: nudes, weddings, and a few others, you have to be my friend first, and ask nicely. I'm likely to do it for free, though). <br /><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-2.jpg" ></a><br /><br />What else? Mad drama which is now solved and not worth talking about; staying in andrew's house; and the internet in the hospital is down, so I'm posting tethered to my phone. We blinged alex's walker. Chilled on the plaza. Lots of drinking in small portions, a beer here, a glass of wine there. I haven't been really drunk for several days, though. Now, Photos!
