	  <h2><a href="/2009/05/14/the-wreck.html">the wreck</a></h2>
	  since I've told this about twenty times yesterday and today, and a lot of those tellings were under the influence of strong drugs, i figure one more time won't hurt.<br /><br />i was riding my bike into town on 4th street and a car <span >t-boned me</span> hit me from the rear. The lady said she was singing to her kids. my lights were on, and i'd bet they weren't looking. I can't remember any of what happened. paramedics said the car was pretty messed up, but they also noticed I had my lights on. at least the car didn't run off. <br /><br />they took me to ou med center, where they determined I have a spinal fracture but no damage to my spinal cord. bruised ribs, some cuts, and my right ankle is stiff. I'm alive and I'll heal, which is the good news. i'm going to be laid up for a while though, have to wear a torso brace for 6 weeks. <br /><br />everybody's been awesome, thanks for all the support, food, books, and just dropping in to visit. I'm here till tomorrow at least, then home and more rest. pills. no bike for a while. if you want to get in touch but don't have my number, just send me a direct message on twitter. laters.<br /><br />(Edit to fix how the accident happened, I was more bruised on one side than the other, making me think I was t-boned).

	  <h2><a href="/2009/05/12/finally-i-know-where-the-flats-are-coming-from.html">Finally, I know where the flats are coming from</a></h2>
	  Or at least some of them. It's a bad idea to leave your bike in a hot car- heat raises pressure and softens rubber, and then before you know it, you've had 10 flats in just a few weeks. And it's always a bummer to go out to get your wheels for a ride and find flats. <br /><br />Last night was a typical monday- blue note pool, tommy g night ride, but with a couple bonuses. Ran into some people who told me rumors of photo work, so that's pretty awesome. Also: Alibi's, which I'd never been to before last night, has $3 bottomless cups of beer. It's shitty light beer, but it will make drunkface just fine. <br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Meet Tasha. Cool chick. I fixed her bike a little. And by fixed her bike, you know what I mean. Flat tire, of course.<br /></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So, after some drinking, it was time to ride and work off the beer. We got about a mile, and then I had a blowout. My guess is my rim strip already had a hole from the first blowout of the night, which happened in my car before the evening started. So, I had to sit around and wait for some one to go grab my car, and then we made a walmart run for more tubes, and then the ride was back on. <br /><br /><span class="caption"  >self, tasha. Tommy needs his own camera, he's got a good eye.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />By the time we were actually riding, it was 3:30am. We did a couple parking garages, a little bricktown, I skidded the ramp in front of the theater (it's a really long ass ramp, ~100 yards), and the freewheel riding dudes (tommy and lem) I was with didn't care. <br /><br /><span class="caption"  >"Wouldn't it be cool to climb that fire escape," Tommy said. "Except for the fall and die part," I said.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Lem</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Tommy<br /></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/05/10/water-boarding-party.html">Water Boarding Party</a></h2>
	  remember when I said I was bored with taking pictures of drunk people? somebody heard that and responded with the wildest, craziest thing I've ever seen at a party. They had a water boarding party. In priest robes.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />They swore up and down that they'd gotten them legally. The robes. And as for the water torture, well, what's a little torture between friends?<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Actually, everyone pouring got poured on too, so it was at least sort of fair. And there was a "safe word," in the form of a hammer that the person on the board would drop when they'd had enough. Which was usually seconds. Nobody made it very long.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Right now, you're thinking to yourself, "Did MM get waterboarded?" and the answer is a definite no. I drowned <a href="http://payingoffmyloans.blogspot.com/2008/01/nine-times-ive-nearly-died-pt-1.html">once before</a> (note, the near-death count has gone up since then), was resuscitated, and for about six years of my childhood I didn't go near the water, and I took very shallow baths. So, I don't need to experience simulated drowning, I've had the real thing.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Other than the torture, it was a pretty standard evening, with a lot of beer and liquor consumed, and crashing out on the couch. I hadn't been letting myself get that drunk, but once in a while it's fun. At least I didn't black out.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0021.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0022.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0023.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0024.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0025.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0026.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0027.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0028.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <span class="caption" >Band plays art opening. Man bites dog.<br /></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So yesterday was really crazy. For a dude like me, who doesn't have normal, that means it was extra special. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >A little taste of ISO 25,000. THIS IS HOW REAL MEN TAKE PICTURES.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />(edit out long drawn out account of room cleaning, wheel building, and finally bike tube acquisition, which was crazy to do, but after writing it out, boring to tell). <br /><br /><span class="caption" >These two old dudes were just sitting togetther mooning over each other in a loud bar filled with people a third their age. Aww.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then there was booze cruise and Sauced and Hi lo, and hanging out at Erin/Colby's place, with some random Cmay thrown in just because my night wasn't interesting enough already. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >People always do this. Not usually in triplicate, though.<br /></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />On a random somewhat tangentially related note (but who wants boring details?) I realized last night that I like philosophies that allow me to do nothing and reap benefits for it. That's all. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Bike ride? Bike ride.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
