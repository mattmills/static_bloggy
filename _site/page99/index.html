	  But the volume knob <a href="http://paulsboutique.beastieboys.com">here</a> is pretty badass. Actually yesterday I was talking mad shit on flash for web design because it usually sucks and just does the same stuff that you can do faster and better in javascript... but this I have no idea how I'd do, and it's a cool effect.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/02/02/new-furniture.html">New Furniture...</a></h2>
	  So I got a new couch today, courtesy of Grant (hi grant). The best way to get me to clean is to move furniture, and/or get new furniture. Something about rearranging everything makes me want to organize all my crap and throw away all the various detritus I collect over time. So, after sleeping through the super bowl, I started to work. <br /><br />The room actually seemed to get worse for the first couple hours, so I paused, laid on the new loveseat and listened to tom waits, which for some reason motivated me. <span >Nighthawks at the Diner</span> for anyone who cares. <br /><br />I don't throw away all of my junk; I'm enough of a romantic that some stuff I keep around for sentimental value alone. I have bits and pieces of most of the cameras I've owned over the years for example. The ones that weren't stolen, that is. Certain pictures, too, I just can't part with or throw away prints of, even if they're a little damaged. The tech stuff I'm pretty good about trashing once it's past its prime. So, because it's such a rare occurrence, I give you my room, as clean as it gets:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/clean_room.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Also yesterday, I had my first gig with Take Two productions, and let me say it's nice to work with professionals. I was running the wider of the two video cameras, something I've never done before (all my video experience has been single-camera work, documentary, and as cheap as possible). It took me a few numbers, but I got the hang of it. It didn't help that I was on an hour and a half of sleep; I probably would have been a bit quicker on the uptake, a little smoother, if I had been able to sleep saturday night. Or at night at all; It's 5am and my super nap ended around 9pm. <br /><br />Anyway, I might end up preferring to run video on these gigs, given that I get more work from take 2; there's less pressure. We'll see. I haven't done stills for them yet, and I'd like to try that too; It's more in my bones to do stills. This site isn't "videographermattmills" for a reason. Anyway, my newly clean and cleared bed is calling my name.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/01/31/cmays-party-then-some-booze-cruise.html">cmay's party, then some booze cruise</a></h2>
	  Last night I went to Royal Bavaria for Christa May's birthday. Christa is the evil genius behind <a href="http://furburger.org">Furburger</a>  for those that don't know. It was a fun time, except the service sucked.  And I was off my game, not that many good photos.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Then We all headed into the city, ostensibly to go sing Karaoke at the Celebrity Club (no celebrities there though). They were at capacity, so I headed over to the rooster, caught up with booze cruise (which didn't cruise that much).<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Then we moved on to a house party, Cody and Steve's new spot:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />This Girl Was madly in love with her board:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Cody trying to pass out:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0007.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Can you tell that's the same bed Cody was in? Can you guess what's going on?<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0008.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />It's all good in the end. Or at least it was when I was leaving:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0009.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Then home, to sleep for 12 hours. Whenever I sleep dep, the crash is the best part. I'm guessing that's why I wasn't shooting that great, I was exhausted from not sleeping much, just a couple naps in a couple days really. Anyway, it's time to ride again.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/01/29/the-3-cure-for-cabin-fever.html">The $3 Cure for Cabin Fever</a></h2>
	  yesterday, after far too long inside the house, I drove downtown for three dollar burgers at Mcnellie's with a bunch of people. Ended up being nine or ten of us, crowded around a table for 7, but it was good. Delicious food and friends and some photos were just what the doctor ordered. <br /><br />In other news, I think I'm going to spend the better part of tonight folding paper. The maquette is printed, I just have to fold everything and sew it together. Oh yeah, and cut up the last few photos. Speaking of photos:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" />
