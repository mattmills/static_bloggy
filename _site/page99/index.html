	  <h2><a href="/2009/01/31/cmays-party-then-some-booze-cruise.html">cmay's party, then some booze cruise</a></h2>
	  Last night I went to Royal Bavaria for Christa May's birthday. Christa is the evil genius behind <a href="http://furburger.org">Furburger</a>  for those that don't know. It was a fun time, except the service sucked.  And I was off my game, not that many good photos.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Then We all headed into the city, ostensibly to go sing Karaoke at the Celebrity Club (no celebrities there though). They were at capacity, so I headed over to the rooster, caught up with booze cruise (which didn't cruise that much).<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Then we moved on to a house party, Cody and Steve's new spot:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />This Girl Was madly in love with her board:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Cody trying to pass out:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0007.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Can you tell that's the same bed Cody was in? Can you guess what's going on?<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0008.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />It's all good in the end. Or at least it was when I was leaving:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0009.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Then home, to sleep for 12 hours. Whenever I sleep dep, the crash is the best part. I'm guessing that's why I wasn't shooting that great, I was exhausted from not sleeping much, just a couple naps in a couple days really. Anyway, it's time to ride again.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/01/29/the-3-cure-for-cabin-fever.html">The $3 Cure for Cabin Fever</a></h2>
	  yesterday, after far too long inside the house, I drove downtown for three dollar burgers at Mcnellie's with a bunch of people. Ended up being nine or ten of us, crowded around a table for 7, but it was good. Delicious food and friends and some photos were just what the doctor ordered. <br /><br />In other news, I think I'm going to spend the better part of tonight folding paper. The maquette is printed, I just have to fold everything and sew it together. Oh yeah, and cut up the last few photos. Speaking of photos:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/01/27/no-way-theyre-really-thinking-about-this-in-oklahoma.html">no way they're really thinking about this in oklahoma</a></h2>
	  in response to some stuff on facebook, about nuclear power in oklahoma, and maybe putting it somewhere out in the desert:<br /><br />the problem is nuclear waste stays dangerous for 10,000 plus years. We're talking geologic time here. There's barely anything manmade left from 10000 years ago, much less a solid intact structure. It's a fool's gambit to put this stuff in a salt mine or inside a mountain because any number of unforeseen events could leak the waste into the biosphere. <br /><br />Of course, the waste is only a small part of the overall problem of radioactivity. People talk about Chernobyl and Three mile island as if they were the only nuclear accidents to ever happen, but actually they happen more frequently than you'd like to think. see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents">wikipedia</a> for more examples, although I'm sure that list is incomplete. These are built by the lowest bidder, remember. <br /><br />"Support in the short term" is like saying ok, a little poison is all right. This stuff is so toxic (before, during and after use) that we build ten foot concrete walls around it, then put more security and perimeters around that, and then beyond that is a line where you don't have to wear a dosimeter any more. There are workers in some facilities who can never leave, because they themselves were irradiated so much that they are toxic to the outside world. (I have a feeling that they don't last long like this).<br /><br />edit to add: <a href="http://newsok.com/proponents-make-case-for-nuclear-in-oklahoma/article/3336983">the article from the oklahoman</a>. Seems there aren't any real plans, just some legislators getting their panties in a bunch. 8 to ten years until they become operational is another problem for an "interim" solution.
