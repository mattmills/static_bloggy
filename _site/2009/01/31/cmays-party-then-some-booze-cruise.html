  <h2>cmay's party, then some booze cruise</h2>
  Last night I went to Royal Bavaria for Christa May's birthday. Christa is the evil genius behind <a href="http://furburger.org">Furburger</a>  for those that don't know. It was a fun time, except the service sucked.  And I was off my game, not that many good photos.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Then We all headed into the city, ostensibly to go sing Karaoke at the Celebrity Club (no celebrities there though). They were at capacity, so I headed over to the rooster, caught up with booze cruise (which didn't cruise that much).<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Then we moved on to a house party, Cody and Steve's new spot:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />This Girl Was madly in love with her board:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Cody trying to pass out:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0007.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Can you tell that's the same bed Cody was in? Can you guess what's going on?<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0008.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />It's all good in the end. Or at least it was when I was leaving:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0009.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Then home, to sleep for 12 hours. Whenever I sleep dep, the crash is the best part. I'm guessing that's why I wasn't shooting that great, I was exhausted from not sleeping much, just a couple naps in a couple days really. Anyway, it's time to ride again.
