  <h2>Finally, I know where the flats are coming from</h2>
  Or at least some of them. It's a bad idea to leave your bike in a hot car- heat raises pressure and softens rubber, and then before you know it, you've had 10 flats in just a few weeks. And it's always a bummer to go out to get your wheels for a ride and find flats. <br /><br />Last night was a typical monday- blue note pool, tommy g night ride, but with a couple bonuses. Ran into some people who told me rumors of photo work, so that's pretty awesome. Also: Alibi's, which I'd never been to before last night, has $3 bottomless cups of beer. It's shitty light beer, but it will make drunkface just fine. <br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Meet Tasha. Cool chick. I fixed her bike a little. And by fixed her bike, you know what I mean. Flat tire, of course.<br /></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So, after some drinking, it was time to ride and work off the beer. We got about a mile, and then I had a blowout. My guess is my rim strip already had a hole from the first blowout of the night, which happened in my car before the evening started. So, I had to sit around and wait for some one to go grab my car, and then we made a walmart run for more tubes, and then the ride was back on. <br /><br /><span class="caption"  >self, tasha. Tommy needs his own camera, he's got a good eye.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />By the time we were actually riding, it was 3:30am. We did a couple parking garages, a little bricktown, I skidded the ramp in front of the theater (it's a really long ass ramp, ~100 yards), and the freewheel riding dudes (tommy and lem) I was with didn't care. <br /><br /><span class="caption"  >"Wouldn't it be cool to climb that fire escape," Tommy said. "Except for the fall and die part," I said.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Lem</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Tommy<br /></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
