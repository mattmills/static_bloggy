  <h2>sometimes...</h2>
  Sometimes all you have to do is get out there and push the button. When there are doubts, when the haters are getting to you, when you worry that you're past prime, never going to amount to anything, that's when you've gotta go out and make pictures. Prime the pump, get those psychomotor cues going. Creating something is the best solution to get out of a funk; there are precious few things better than an unexpectedly good picture. I wasn't expecting much out of these, but I really like 'em.<br /><br />Fuck I'm verbose today. Wrote my intro for the OKCITY book too. Might do a limited run(10-20), and publish a pdf for free. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >this is what happens when you double tap long exposures- more often than not one or the other will be good. for this one, the second frame was really blurry.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bluewed/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" >i tried this in black and white, but his eyes really make the picture.
