  <h2>oh yeah, I was supposed to post these...</h2>
  Yeah, meant to put these up yesterday. Got distracted by Hulu again. <span >Royal Pains</span> this time. Good thing House is in the off season, or I'd never get anything done. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Seriously though, I went out to Tulsa to take a break and recharge, sort of reset myself. One of the nice effects of travel is you almost always get a fresh look at yourself while trying to look at a new place, even if that new place is only a couple hours away. I'd been feeling a little blocked up creatively and a weekend away from my routine was just what I needed. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I actually fasted this weekend- not in the "not eating at all" sense of the word but in the "staying hungry" sense. One moderate meal a day, the occasional beer, maybe a snack. Whenever I've tried the cold turkey no food approach, I've failed miserably, because I lack the willpower. One meal a day is enough to give you the edge of feeling hungry without making it into this huge task. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />About that- the edge of hardship- when things are difficult, sometimes it will make you sharper, quicker, more discerning- you can rise to the situation in a way that, when everything is easy, you couldn't. I've always thought the best art comes out of working around limitations, not when the limitations are removed. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
