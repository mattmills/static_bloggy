  <h2>lack of posting (and why)</h2>
  So I've been doing stuff and seeing things, but the reason I haven't been posting that much is this:<br /><br /><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film.jpg"><br /><br />That's almost a week's worth of shooting. I know, I know, that's not a lot, but it will make for about a week's worth of posts, once I get around to developing it. I'm waiting on some money from a lens I sold. (With my canon body out of commission, I didn't need the 24-105 any more, so it went on ebay and sold quick).<br /><br />Meanwhile, there was a race yesterday, Bike Against Hunger the First, which was pretty cool. Kudos to Ken for putting it together and for all the rad prizes. Cody won, and I'd swear he rode up to my checkpoint on one wheel. He was there and gone in about 10 seconds. Yeah though, if you ever get the chance to work a checkpoint, bring a sign and a nice chair. A beverage and a book are optional but the book probably saved my sanity, i just wished I'd had the rest of that stuff. That, and it's impossible to run a checkpoint and take pics of the checkpoint at the same time. It's one or the other. <br /><br />OK, I'm going to save the rest for another day, because there are a lot of stories to tell, and a lot of pictures that go with them, so rather than mix things all about, I'll just wait until I can get the pictures, and then tell the stories.
