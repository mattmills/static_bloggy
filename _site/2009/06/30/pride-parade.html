  <h2>Pride Parade</h2>
  So, it's pride 09. I wasn't on, but these I like. For those who don't know: I'm straight. And I'm not going to lie, this was mostly about being a part of the spectacle and drinking and cooking out for me. But yes, I do support a whole range of gay rights, marriage and equal protection and other things. But this was a party on wheels. <br /><br />I'd like to say the big fail is because of the lack of intimacy with the subject(true), or sub-standard camera equipment(not true), but really it was because I lacked two things: focus and a camera strap. I wasn't focused on taking pictures, more on riding the new bike, and I didn't have a strap to hold the camera so I was constantly death gripping it and worried I would drop it. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Two days before, but already started at the Copa.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >The Bike Horde.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was something about people wearing leather and being gay? Not sure. update from my friend hope who Knows Things: "The picture at the pride parade the people in leather. Its the national leather association. that's what the blue and black flag with the red heart represents. its a BDSM community with a very strong Gay following. I know i always have the strangest information. but there you go."</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This really surprised me; Dell is a big company, glad to see that they were out there in support.

A couple thousand people, easily. All along the route there were spectators, but nothing to make me expect this. </span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
