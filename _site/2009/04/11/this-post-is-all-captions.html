  <span class="caption"  >Went to the bike art opening, a lot of Norman scenesters and young parents in the crowd. The art was ok, the bikes were cool.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >This was the coolest part: the fixed-gear as objet d'art. That and chris' paintings; my only criticism is I wish they were bigger.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >This was supposed to be a bike theremin, but it was about 3/4 fail.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >The jumps they were doing were pretty cool though.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >This is Amanda. The next five pix are another unintentional photo essay. I was basically hanging out with her the whole night, although the background kept changing and some people came and went. </span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >For example: After we left Norman, we went to Estrella and MJ's place. Very cool casa. I'm guessing this was some kind of decorative place setting.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >Does this really need explanation? Seriously.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >Outside the blue note. She says to me "You have your camera?" I say, "Of course," and she runs and jumps and lays down on the sign.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >I know I promised five pictures, and that's because there's a story with this one. This was the hostess at a pary we headed to after the blue note. Shortly after this was taken, this girl grabs Amanda by the hair and won't let go, all for a jello shot cup thrown on the floor. We had a good laugh about that in the car, leaving. Then Reghan (who'd joined us for the blue note and after) shouts out of the window "We know where you live!"</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >This is a true rocker. Notice that Caitlin's entire body is in motion, <span >except for the beer.</span> Epic. </span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  >"Take one for the dudes of america," he said. So I did.</span><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
