	  and because it's her birthday, and because, well, what are friends for? I'm posting yet another huge batch of photos to flickr. This time though, I'm going to be smart and only post highlights here and if you want to see the whole set you can head over there <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photomattmills/sets/72157617411519820/show/">by clicking this finely crafted link</a>.<br /><br />Sometimes I find that I know I have enough good pictures of something and yet I'm still shooting, something is knawing at me to keep going, and I don't really know why. On an "on" night, this means I come away with quite a lot of good stuff. This shoot was about 5% that I liked, and maybe as high as 20% that weren't crap, even by my standards. In a small party, that means a lot of pictures of the same people, and yet some people get missed, too. Sorry if I missed you. <br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/04/19/23rd-street.html">23rd street</a></h2>
	  So I finally got out and shot some yesterday, for the first time in three or four days. I don't know what exactly caused the slump; I've been doing a lot around the house, just sort of hanging out with friends, nothing terribly interesting. So I decided to do something with myself. Calling around to find someone to model failed, everyrone was either recovering from the weekend or not answering their phones.<br /><br />Anyway, no pretty ladies in these pictures. I had the crazy idea to go way out on 23rd street yesterday, and along the way I was sort of pulled in by all the signs I saw. I'm going to have to go back and shoot some more out there; might do a photo-walk of the few miles between choctaw and post road. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >This victorian house was out in the middle of a lot of mobile homes for sale; it looked more like a storage for unwanted uprooted homes than a sales lot.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >I shot this mostly for the patch of light and the clouds.
