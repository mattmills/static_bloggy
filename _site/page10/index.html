	  <p>Please wake me up in my dreams.&quot; Just rediscovering how awesome an album &#8220;Frank&#8217;s Wild Years&#8221; is. Seriously, you should give it a listen. Also &#8220;Romeo is Bleeding&#8221; off of Blue Valentine, very good. Merry Christmas, happy blah blah. Another post coming soon; this won&#8217;t satisfy my blogging addiction for today.</p>

	  <p>Well, one of them&#8230; there were several, actually, but this one is the only one I went to. And there are other good photos, mostly variations on these though. And Atlas (the baby, and isn&#8217;t that a awesome name?) was born the day before yesterday (or was it yesterday? I haven&#8217;t been able to keep track of the days in weeks). If the kid&#8217;s as rad as his parents, he&#8217;s set for a rad life.</p>

	  <p>er, well, it seems that way. Katie wanted some pinup-like pictures, which I&#8217;m not posting, and some more normal ones, which are below. This was a fun shoot. As for the babies, four (five? six? depending on how close of a friend we&#8217;re talking about) friends of varying closeness have had kids in the last 6 months, and several more are expecting. None for me, thanks.</p>

	  <p>I&#8217;m sure someone else will move in and civilize the place now and it won&#8217;t be the hell house any more. This was a good way to go out though, beating a couch into submission with an axe and then burning it in the back yard, and then the fire trucks show up&#8230; yeah. I&#8217;ll miss it a little. That night with the fire was a perfect end to it for me: the right mix of madness and fun and hilarity, and also danger of decapitation/third degree burns.</p>

	  <p>So I knew if I didn&#8217;t get this up now it&#8217;d be after new years before I got to it. I had to improvise a tripod out of duct tape and a light stand. If you click on it, you can see it even bigger. I might have to make some prints of this one&#8230; have to get an ink cartridge first though. hrm. I had lots of clever things to say that I though of while I was outside shooting this but now they&#8217;ve all left my head and I need rest. See you guys in the morning.</p>
