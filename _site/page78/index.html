	  another round of drinking and photos... this was one of those nights that sort of blurred together towards the end... really fun, though, and I woke up in time to head off the hangover with water. Protip: Water works best before you actually feel the hangover. If you already have a headache, you're going to suffer more. <br /><br />Anyway, I rode my bike to get down there, 20 miles in 2.3 hours... terrible time, I know, but I did it, and that's the important part. There was a lot of terror and panic, and anger at everything with four wheels, but it's all part of the show at this point. I've just got to recondition myself, and that's going to take time. How long before I can ride ten miles in half an hour again? I don't know, probably a while. How long before I don't flinch every time a car passes is more important, and hopefully that'll be sooner. Pain and fatigue I can deal with, fear is harder.<br /><br />Less seriously, though, the night was a blast. 2 hours of bike riding to get to 6 hours of party=8 good hours. For example:<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Fabulous shoes.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >B-Bell in classic black and white.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Birthday Girl Shelby.

	  So I forgot to post these- edited them, output jpegs, and then forgot to actually upload and blog them. I thought I did, sorry I lied to you cody. My fault. Anyway, these suffer a little bit from being shot at insanely high ISO on a small format camera, so don't judge too harshly. On a related note, I can't wait to get my new camera and really get to shooting again. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  Sometimes all you have to do is get out there and push the button. When there are doubts, when the haters are getting to you, when you worry that you're past prime, never going to amount to anything, that's when you've gotta go out and make pictures. Prime the pump, get those psychomotor cues going. Creating something is the best solution to get out of a funk; there are precious few things better than an unexpectedly good picture. I wasn't expecting much out of these, but I really like 'em.<br /><br />Fuck I'm verbose today. Wrote my intro for the OKCITY book too. Might do a limited run(10-20), and publish a pdf for free. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >this is what happens when you double tap long exposures- more often than not one or the other will be good. for this one, the second frame was really blurry.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bluewed/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" >i tried this in black and white, but his eyes really make the picture.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/07/09/photo-walk.html">Photo Walk</a></h2>
	  The 4th was a good night; I ended up sort of all over the place, first riding my bike to a party right on the river in Tulsa, and then catching a ride out to the sticks for a huge bash in a field (this being the 4th, and it being oklahoma, nobody's day is complete without going out into the middle of nowhere and Blowing Shit Up). <br /><br />We get there and there's a $10 cover per head. Then we stand in line for beer for half an hour for 3.2 bud light. Then, just as I'm tweeting about how a fight would be a nice mood lifter, it starts to rain. So, the people who have tents run for them, and the people who don't run for their cars. I'm not lying when I say that I probably had a better time sitting in that car listening to music and talking than I would have getting obliterated and setting fire to the whole party. <br /><br />Then we bailed and headed back to Tim's apartment, where everybody just crashed. Which meant that my bike was across downtown from me when I woke up in the morning, so of course, I went to get it. I didn't <span >have to</span> walk, I could have waited for a ride to pick it up, but the walk appealed to me. And then there were photos:<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0008.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0009.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0010.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0011.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0012.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0013.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0014.jpg" alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/07/07/oh-yeah-i-was-supposed-to-post-these.html">oh yeah, I was supposed to post these...</a></h2>
	  Yeah, meant to put these up yesterday. Got distracted by Hulu again. <span >Royal Pains</span> this time. Good thing House is in the off season, or I'd never get anything done. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Seriously though, I went out to Tulsa to take a break and recharge, sort of reset myself. One of the nice effects of travel is you almost always get a fresh look at yourself while trying to look at a new place, even if that new place is only a couple hours away. I'd been feeling a little blocked up creatively and a weekend away from my routine was just what I needed. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I actually fasted this weekend- not in the "not eating at all" sense of the word but in the "staying hungry" sense. One moderate meal a day, the occasional beer, maybe a snack. Whenever I've tried the cold turkey no food approach, I've failed miserably, because I lack the willpower. One meal a day is enough to give you the edge of feeling hungry without making it into this huge task. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />About that- the edge of hardship- when things are difficult, sometimes it will make you sharper, quicker, more discerning- you can rise to the situation in a way that, when everything is easy, you couldn't. I've always thought the best art comes out of working around limitations, not when the limitations are removed. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
