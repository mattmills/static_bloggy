	  I've experienced the situation that word describes so many times it's excruciating. Not this weekend though. No future exes found, just a lot of Santa Fe love. It's a mad cool town. I'm stuck in a rut, and then I go there and I start to do stuff again. Looking for a model to play around in front of a white backdrop. We'll see. Pictures!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Alex on a trike.

He's a monster and he's going to take over the world.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-7.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Finally, here's Alex's fingers. From the bus hitting him, his right pinky is not right.<br /><br />And I just cut a picture of a sunset arbitrarily, and I'm declaring no more sun/cloud pictures for a while. Shit gets old, even if they are pretty.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/07/07/on-selling-out.html">on selling out</a></h2>
	  I set aside my beliefs for money. I work for people that take oil and gas out of the ground and sell it. Never mind that it's a lot of money. Never mind that extractive industries are not bad, that the particular people I work for are separated by degrees from anything I can call wrong, that the companies that are their clients are good, performing a needed service. <br /><br />Let's examine what belief I'm setting aside here. Is it my deeply held belief that capitalism is evil, that corporations by their nature do bad things? I don't believe either of those things without reserve, though. Unregulated capitalism is completely unsustainable and self destructs. The last time this happened, we called it the great depression. But with good regulation, Capitalism isn't a bad system, so long as basic human needs (food, shelter, water, medicine) aren't subject to market economies. They are in a lot of places, and this seems to lead to tragedy (see for example, water strikes in south America, recent food crises worldwide, the healthcare system here in the states). So no, capitalism isn't essentially evil, but the uses it's put to make it do bad things. <br /><br />Corporations, though, are pretty bad. They make lots of money, which is the problem. You can't get money without someone else losing money, resources, time, or all of the above. In general, the little guy gets screwed. In my work though, luckily for all te rights holders, there are laws binding whoever drills and extracts to pay what they owe, to clean up after themselves, and generally good corporate citizens. At least here, in the little area I'm working in, they don't really do anything bad. They perform a service, pay for what they take, and the common good is served. <br /><br />Oil though, there's a big topic. I don't think we should go to war over oil. I think our burn rate (of energy total) is outrageous, that we should be able to make do with a quarter (or less) of what we use. I'm not an engineer, though. I <a href="http://opensourcecameraproject.org">make</a> things sometimes, but I'm not going to come up with the replacement for fossil fuels. It <a href="http://www.focusfusion.org">will</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polywell">happen</a> though. So again, it's a wash. With or without me, the days of burning hydrocarbons for energy are numbered. <br /><br />So, if what I'm doing doesn't conflict with any of my beliefs, makes me money to let me do what I want to do, is that still selling out?<br /><br />(edit: fixed the broken link to focus fusion society)

	  So I'm at my uncle's house in texas right now, and we were all sitting outside and I was shooting some long exposures of people, and pat says something to the effect of "Doesn't matter how fancy your camera is, you need some light."<br /><br />So, I keep shooting. I get this:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog705-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog705-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Obviously not the camera. It's the fake mustache on the front.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/07/02/thumb.html">thumb</a></h2>
	  first of all, my thumb is fine. I lost a chunk of skin, that's all. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/arts/design/24isla.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">This is hilarious.</a> <br /><br /><a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/galleries/split_second/">Barbra Probst</a> on her photos of the same subject, same instant, from many perspectives. Her comment about not caring about what's in the pictures so much as how they're taken is bullshit, and a good example of why you don't have to listen to what the artist says all the time. It's a cool idea, though, and the photos are really interesting, so go look.<br /><br />And as for my photography, I've finally realized what I need to do. I'm at a bit of a creative dead end, not knowing what to do for a while. So, I'm gonna bust with the white seamless (see <a href="http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=0&a=0&mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&p=7&at=0">Richard Avedon</a>) to get the juices flowing again. I even have a model in mind, if she's free next weekend. now, to the shower.
