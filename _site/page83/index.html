	  This is sort of a test post, I'm mucking about with the stylesheet. I'm also writing some essays for the photobook I've been trying to do since january. Wednesday was a success though, in that I got out and had a good time. And I took some photos. The style might not be right, but I'm working on it. <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bbwt/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bbwt/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bbwt/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bbwt/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  This is from the rest of the last batch of processing. Traci (last picture) came and rescued me from my stircrazyness on Friday, whereupon we went downtown and walked around, lots of fun things to see around that time of day, just as work is getting out. Then there was sauced pizza and a norman party, where everybody thought my brace was fake until I told them the story. Getting out again, I've told that same story 20 million times. hopefully I'm done telling it now, but I have a feeling I won't be able to stop until I'm done wearing the brace.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >My dad, playing with the dog.

	  since I've had to resort to shooting film, I had to get it processed, and there was this random roll that has been on my printer stand for a while, so I had it done as well. These are from the end of spring 2006, at the annual Doc Studies barbecue. Looking at this old work, I couldn't help but notice how different it is, and how much higher a percentage of misses I had back then, even with the same camera & lens.  <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Two of the graduating seniors.</span><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Professors standing around.

	  I forgot my cf cards, and so I had to improvise and use my phone camera to take a few pictures. It was a very zen experience shooting this way, with complete simplicity. I was able to concentrate soley on the images.  you only have one button to push, and that's it. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I was sitting there, at sauced, at Haley's booth, and I was watching all the ametures with their digital rebels, and I realized that the difference between them and the professionals I had worked around and with was principally one of concentration. The pros are zeroed in on what they are doing, the only thing in the world for them is the viewfinder. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Matty from the Rodchenko(sp?) angle. </span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />On a completely different note, I found a really cool company called Elphel building the open source camera I dreamed up last year. they sell a bunch of boards that could theoretically turn any old 35mm film camera into a digital camera, in either black and white or color. Their examples kinda suck, and I suspect it has something to do with the tone curves they're using, but if I can get the parts and get it to spit out 16 bit raw data, I would be one happy matt mills. For the nerds: <a href="http://www3.elphel.com/">Elphel's web site</a>. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
