	  I've never before actually needed to ride in one, but they say there's a first for everything. Today, I used one of those electric carts to get around sams. FYI, they're a pain when you have to use them. That and for some reason I kept getting dirty looks; I guess because I have the brace on under my shirt people thought I was a healthy person abusing the cart, if that were possible. Oh well.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/05/21/out-of-the-house.html">Out of the house</a></h2>
	  Went out last night. Did the whole blue note/ladies night thing. Tommy G came and picked me up, and off we went, into the night. It was nice to see some of the people out that I hadn't seen in two weeks. Of course, as sure as the night before, the morning after is a bitch. I woke up and I couldn't move, there was a lot of pain. I'm sure it was a combination of attempting to detox and the night out, but still, I'm glad the pain pills were within arms reach. <br /><br />So, as things stand, I still need to get a lawyer, I don't know if there's going to be long term damage, and I still don't have a job. Sometimes I need the pain pills and sometimes I don't. it seems to depend on what I've been doing more than anything; the easier I take it, the better off I am. <br /><br />On the good news list, I have a camera now, thanks to Ken's boss. It's a digi Rebel, nothing to write home about, but it's functional, at least, and I figure I could do worse. It's not like I have any assignments anyway. Project idea: Photograph all the stuff people have loaned/given me while convalescing. I might work on that after my nap. photos of last night to follow later too.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/05/17/fallout.html">fallout</a></h2>
	  I write this blog for two reasons, to share pictures and so all the people in my life, no matter how far flung, can get an idea of what's going on in my life. Now, since I had the wreck last tuesday, I've only posted once, just putting up some details and leaving it at that. Since then I've been popping pain pills at regular intervals and working my way through the stack of comic books and movies my friends brought by. Then someone bitches in the comments that I'm boring him. I told him to go fuck himself, because, hey, I deserve a couple days off for the broken back. <br /><br />On the other hand, I do have a few updates to pass along. I got out of the hospital Friday, and promptly took a nap. When I woke up I realized I hadn't looked at my camera in several days, so I pulled it out and found it was broken. My 50mm 1.2 won't autofocus and the mode dial no longer works at all. And the battery door is broken off. The bag I was carrying has a hole in it, too.<br /><br />It's hard to get up and down, but I can walk and stand pretty well, although that does depend on me keeping up with the pain pills- one every four hours and I can move and function pretty well. On the pain meds, I can do most normal stuff.<br /><br />I didn't take any before I went to sleep last night, mostly because I was feeling fine and I really don't like the drugged feeling. This morning, I was regretting that decision, because all of the minor aches had turned to major ones, and it was a task just to sit up in bed. I took pills, and now I'm fine. I can't wait for the day when I don't depend on pills to get around the house. Should be soon.

	  since I've told this about twenty times yesterday and today, and a lot of those tellings were under the influence of strong drugs, i figure one more time won't hurt.<br /><br />i was riding my bike into town on 4th street and a car <span >t-boned me</span> hit me from the rear. The lady said she was singing to her kids. my lights were on, and i'd bet they weren't looking. I can't remember any of what happened. paramedics said the car was pretty messed up, but they also noticed I had my lights on. at least the car didn't run off. <br /><br />they took me to ou med center, where they determined I have a spinal fracture but no damage to my spinal cord. bruised ribs, some cuts, and my right ankle is stiff. I'm alive and I'll heal, which is the good news. i'm going to be laid up for a while though, have to wear a torso brace for 6 weeks. <br /><br />everybody's been awesome, thanks for all the support, food, books, and just dropping in to visit. I'm here till tomorrow at least, then home and more rest. pills. no bike for a while. if you want to get in touch but don't have my number, just send me a direct message on twitter. laters.<br /><br />(Edit to fix how the accident happened, I was more bruised on one side than the other, making me think I was t-boned).
