	  <p>Taking photos of skaters is weird. I was doing it today, again, and really, it&#8217;s a completely different thing from photographing other kinds of athletes or doing regular portraits. It requires you to be very close to the action- you&#8217;ve got to be careful not to make yourself an obstacle while being in the middle of things, basically. Anyway, yeah. I&#8217;ve been off the last month. not shooting as well as I usually do. I&#8217;ll get it sorted. I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s just the winter blues, which usually go away as things warm up.</p>

	  <p>Not about these photos, which are decent. I&#8217;m going to a rally today, in solidarity with the people in wisconsin. It&#8217;s another one of those moments in history. Revolutions across the world. Protests here in the US. People who are nostalgic for the late 60&#8217;s, wake up and get your ases down to the capitol. It&#8217;s a good time to be alive. And it is Oklahoma. Not a lot likely to happen here. (I know I just jinxed myself. The knowing negates it). But still, anything can happen. Anyway, enjoy the photos and pay attention to twitter for updates on the ground.</p>
<p>(edit: decided I didn&#8217;t like that first photo. poof! like it was never there). <br />

	  <p>well, I opened this tab yesterday, and the dream I was going to write about has pretty much evaporated from my memory. Oh well. The first photo is from elemental, at there new shop, the first morning they were open&#8230; it was sort of beautiful how thin their operation was, and how well it worked. There was one woman with a square reader taking credit cards, and one barista making amazing espresso drinks. It&#8217;s gottena bit better now, even&#8230; I think they have heat in their building, and some more furniture. Really exciting to see a new business start up an do so well.</p>
<p>the rest of the photos are the usual fare, from a night out at blue note.</p>

	  <p>This shit was a blast. seriously a lot of fun. As in, we&#8217;re going to have to do it again. Thanks to (in no particular order): Amber (hair and makeup), Brian (lights/grip), KJ, and Meghan (models). Anyway, yeah. Photos. I&#8217;m splitting this into two posts to ease the server load. Next one in a hot minute.</p>
