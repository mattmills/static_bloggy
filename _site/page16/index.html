	  <p>Well, I promised fun and adventure and pretty ladies, and the last two or three weeks have been full of that. Also full of chest cold sickness, but I&#8217;m 90-95% better now. I haven&#8217;t been this sick from a cold in years and years. The only thing keeping me together has been orange juice and cold pills. The cold pills don&#8217;t exactly seem to work, but they&#8217;re not hurting that I can tell. Anyway, this party was before I got sick.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2010/10/13/saga-of-the-lens.html">saga of the lens</a></h2>
	  <p>So, my 50mm (<a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/50mm-f14-afs.htm">this one</a>) broke the other night with little warning. middle of a shoot, and it stops focusing. My spare 50 was at home in pieces, and my other lenses were also at home. This is the reality of getting ambushed with shoots in the middle of a road trip. Welcome to my life.</p>
<p>Anyway, thinking that someone had spilled beer on my lens, I (somewhat desperately) ran it under the faucet in the bathroom, and that seemed to restore some limited movement to it, so I went with it. Of course, that wasn&#8217;t what the real problem was, and no water actually got in the lens because it&#8217;s weather sealed. More on that in a minute.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the blue note tuesday night, and the lens had given up completely, and another rinse did nothing. Now, I&#8217;d already sent this lens to nikon once for this same problem, I told them to clean it, and when it came back it seemed all right. But here it was again, and so I was having visions of buying a new lens that wouldn&#8217;t have this recurring problem. Probably <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/5014af.htm">this one</a>. So, that decision made, I figured I had nothing to lose by taking the lens apart last night and seeing if I could at least figure out what was causing the problem.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t as odd as it sounds. I&#8217;m pretty adept at fixing things in a general way. Cars, bikes, appliances, laptops, whatever. They&#8217;re machines, not magic boxes. So I got out my trusty phillips head and started unscrewing (protip: modern lenses usually disassemble from the flange). What I discovered, once I was inside, was, well, odd.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20101014-kqd7x6qdr21aceeajgygpqgtek.jpg" alt="lens_inside_2"/></p>
<p>The inside of the lens was more like a laptop than any of the other lenses I&#8217;ve worked on. That actually made it easier, thank god. Lenses are usually a bitch to work with, which is why I wait till I&#8217;ve got nothing left to lose to try anything. Anyway, one of the layers in my lens, the one marked in the photo above, was off, like it&#8217;d been knocked out of place. My suspicion is that it&#8217;s just held in place by spring tension, and a combination of bad knocks and bad luck threw it off. But, more to the point, it shouldn&#8217;t be loose like that. This is a top-line relatively new lens, supposedly professional grade. It certainly cost me enough.</p>
<p>Anyway, now it&#8217;s back together and mostly working&#8230; the autofocus isn&#8217;t, but I can at least manually focus, and that&#8217;s enough for now. Maybe when I get that replacement lens I&#8217;ll tear it down again and see if I can fix it completely.</p>

	  <p>So, I&#8217;ve been having some issues with the site, mostly due to my own idiocy, but I think they&#8217;re resolved and anything that happens from now on will be filed under &#8216;new issues&#8217;. Note: When configuring nginx, just tell it to listen on port 80, leave off the &#8216;default&#8217; that most configurations seem to have. If you need ssl too, that&#8217;s port 443. There.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some pictures. I&#8217;ve been down with some kind of chest cold/flu, but I&#8217;m coming back slowly. Coughing and hacking all the way, and a sinus infection to boot, but I&#8217;m not all run down the way I was there for a while. I think I must&#8217;ve picked it up at the fair.</p>
<p>This is a weird admonishment. I don&#8217;t know why, exactly, but telling people to take comfort in rituals, when that&#8217;s most of what people do already, well, it freaked me out a little. It&#8217;s like saying &#8216;Be complacent, be normal&#8217;. Odd.</p>
