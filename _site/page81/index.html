	  for once, i actually managed to Shoot pictures of mom from start to finish in the hospital. This visit was more than a little silly. She had a non-specific infection, possbly blood, possibly kidney, but they made her stay in the hospital for 4 days when she could have stayed at home. Ostensibly it was to monitor her, but I don' think we would have done a worse job of that at home. Add to that the stress factor of being in the hospital, and the whole thing was kind of ridiculous. <br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">Mom the day she went to the dialysis clinic with a fever.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">The first cultures, which were the only ones that came back positive.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">Hallway going into Presbyterian Tower, OU Med center. </span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">Mom coming back from the vending machines.

	  All I have to say is I was really off that night. A lot of blurry pics from too low a shutter speed. So that's why the coverage isn't as good as it should be.   <br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" />

	  These pictures are all from the raddest ride kickoff/fundraiser ever. Stuart, Pat and Cameron are heading across the country on the <a href="http://broquest.com/">Broquest</a> (link goes to their site). This is why film sucks sometimes; I'm just now getting the pics from their out of town party up and they're already three states into their Portland to Portland run. Oh well.<br /><br />The Dudes of America played, and they're a bunch of rockstars. I'm too lazy to caption, you can figure it out. That and I'm blogging while flying down the highway. wah-hoo.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0007.jpg" alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/06/19/random.html">random</a></h2>
	  So I've finally gotten my film developed, and the first batch is just some random photos. There was another roll of old film I found in a drawer, and I think at least one of these is from that. It's really weird and difficult to be working with files scanned from film automatically. I can't adjust exposure or white balance or any of that good stuff. Oh well, at least they're better than nothing. I can't wait until I get a new body in though. <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
