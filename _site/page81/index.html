	  <h2><a href="/2009/06/24/oh-the-life-of-a-freelancer.html">Oh the life of a freelancer...</a></h2>
	  A week ago, I went down to medicine park to assist <a href ="http://www.jeremycharles.com">Jeremy Charles</a> with a little advertorial. Hold the reflector, keep the lights from blowing away, that sort of thing. While I was there, I had a little down time to walk up the main drag and shoot a few pics of the town, and while details were being decided, I was able to shoot the little kid who was the subject of the ad in question. It was nice to get out and shoot in the mode of dropping into a location, gestalting, and shooting pictures based on those impressions. <br /><br />It's also always nice to work with a pro of Jeremy's caliber, someone who knows their look, knows their gear, lights, who "gets it." That said, working with a family of four who are inexperienced in front of the camera, and having two small kids in that mix, was stressful.    <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0009.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0010.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0011.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0012.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0013.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0014.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0015.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0016.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0017.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0018.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>

	  <h2><a href="/2009/06/23/mom-was-in-the-hospital.html">Mom was in the hospital...</a></h2>
	  for once, i actually managed to Shoot pictures of mom from start to finish in the hospital. This visit was more than a little silly. She had a non-specific infection, possbly blood, possibly kidney, but they made her stay in the hospital for 4 days when she could have stayed at home. Ostensibly it was to monitor her, but I don' think we would have done a worse job of that at home. Add to that the stress factor of being in the hospital, and the whole thing was kind of ridiculous. <br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">Mom the day she went to the dialysis clinic with a fever.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">The first cultures, which were the only ones that came back positive.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">Hallway going into Presbyterian Tower, OU Med center. </span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">Mom coming back from the vending machines. Not happy.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" font-size="smaller">In the last few minutes of her stay, the doctor came in and removed her catheter.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0005.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />On the other hand, she did feel quite a bit better getting out (no more infection), and she doesn't have a cardiac catheter any more- the leg graft they did several months ago is working, and as of today, she's about halfway through training to stick herself and do the whole thing at home again.

	  All I have to say is I was really off that night. A lot of blurry pics from too low a shutter speed. So that's why the coverage isn't as good as it should be.   <br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" />
