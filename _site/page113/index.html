	  <h2><a href="/2008/07/20/rule-1-always-have-your-camera.html">Rule</a></h2>
	  So, instead of boring you with stupid vapid details of my life that nobody cares about but me, and that I in all likelihood won't care about tomorrow, I'm going to write about photography. Methods, rules and techniques. These are old school "learn to use then learn to break" rules. My 1000 word photo one lesson will be in here. The stuff I was thinking about for<span > Methods of Photography</span> will be here. Meanderings, maybe. How I work, definitely.<br /><br />OK, rule 1: Always carry your camera. Other people should think you have codependency issues with that machine. It doesn't matter if your chosen instrument weighs one ounce or five pounds, it should always be with you. Other people will think you're crazy, and that's fine. Other people don't have to be on the que vive to do their work. They can note an idea and follow up on monday. We photographers are forever here and now.<br /><br />I carry 15 lbs of camera and lenses and batteries everywhere. I carry it so much I got home from the store yesterday, went out back to grill hot dogs, and I didn't even realize I still had the bag on until I tried to sit down.<br /><br />Speaking of bags, the bag you carry your shit in is also important, if you use one. It's gotta be bombproof, bulletproof, waterproof, and just a little bigger than you think. Quick access. Padding or no is up to you. I use unpadded bags because I hate the added bulk of padding and most of them are in either unfashionable or unfunctional shapes. There is more variety of good unpadded bags. Right now I use a crumpler. In the past, it's been a domke, but I saw the crumpler in REI and had to have it. It's only the third bag I've ever had that I really liked. I carry one body plus two lenses, sometimes three. No flash. Spare batteries. Pick the things you think you need, carry them around for a little while, get rid of them if you decide you don't use them enough to be worth the weight.<br /><br />Because sometimes, you just need your camera, and you'll never know when that's going to be. You're going to be tired, barely able to move, eyes closing involuntarily, and there, in front of you, will be the perfect pictures unfolding. What good is seeing as a photographer sees (in pictures, of course) if you haven't a camera to put it to use?

	  <h2><a href="/2008/07/20/1000-words.html">1000 words</a></h2>
	  Everything you need to know about shooting pictures in 1000 words:<br /><br />First, we're talking from a purely technical standpoint. What does what and a little of why. This is the iambic pentameter to sonnets we all hope our photographs will be. A photograph is an image formed by the action of photons on a sensitive medium. The light is usually focused by a lens, or concentrated by a pinhole, to form a coherent image of the world in front of the camera. <br /><br />The three things you have control over are focus, exposure, and where to point the camera. We are only dealing with the first two, thank the gods. The third is enough to talk about for centuries. Focus and exposure are controlled by four interrelated settings or choices: ISO (sensitivity of your medium), Shutter speed, aperture, and focus distance. In the old days, you chose an ISO and film like you chose a religion, but now there's a lot of room for play because everything can be changed on a whim.<br />ds<br /><br />About exposure: Too much light makes the picture all white. Too little light and the picture goes black. There is an amount of light that is just right for the scene you're trying to take a picture of, and this is called the correct exposure. The light and dark of a picture can be largely creative, but a new photographer should get a feel for correct exposure before doing anything crazy. Most any camera these days has a pretty good meter built in, but the right exposure isn't always what your meter tells you. Sometimes it's brighter, sometimes it's darker. Meters try to get a scene to hit in the middle of their tonal range. A scene with a lot of white, or bright things in it, will come out too dark. A scene with a lot of dark shadows or blacks will come out too light. Middle gray is boring. We need more than that. <br /><br />Enter the three factors that you can use to affect exposure. They are all measured in f-stops, which is a logarithmic scale which halves or doubles the light for each step. If you go up one stop on the shutter speed and down one stop on the aperture, the amount of light stays the same. Some people will quibble over halfs and thirds of stops, these people are the enemy and should not be invited for dinner. <br /><br />The scale (in full stop increments) of shutter speeds is 1/8000, 1/4000, 1/2000, 1/1000, 1/500, 1/250, 1/125, 1/60, 1/30, 1/15, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, etc. Those are fractions of a second. That's how much time you have. The 1/ is left off on most cameras for brevity and simplicity. Speeds of less than 1/30 are likely to result in blurry pictures because of camera shake. The more time you give to the exposure, the more light gets in. <br />

	  so I went back to santa fe last weekend, saw some folks, did some santa fe things. I didn't go to whole foods. I did go into the mountains a couple times. Hit up the cowgirl, the tin star, and the catamount in a single night. stayed with alex, saw some other heads, missed Nicole somehow, I think she was herself just getting back from cali. <br /><br />It's not that okc is bad, it's that other places are so much better. Pictures to follow.

	  I've experienced the situation that word describes so many times it's excruciating. Not this weekend though. No future exes found, just a lot of Santa Fe love. It's a mad cool town. I'm stuck in a rut, and then I go there and I start to do stuff again. Looking for a model to play around in front of a white backdrop. We'll see. Pictures!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Alex on a trike. Why not?<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Tourists.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>In the woods.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>At the tin star, I think this guy was some kind of big deal. Even if he wasn't he sure could play.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>And this little kid was too awesome . me and Alex decided he was a combination of the two of us- loves to take stuff apart (me) and totally narcissistic (Al), loving attention. He's a monster and he's going to take over the world.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-7.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Finally, here's Alex's fingers. From the bus hitting him, his right pinky is not right.<br /><br />And I just cut a picture of a sunset arbitrarily, and I'm declaring no more sun/cloud pictures for a while. Shit gets old, even if they are pretty.
