	  It's remarkably like the old blog, except that it's all on my own server, and much less prone to downtime than tumblr was. Also, I managed to import all the old posts from the "five years" blog I had on blogger. So that's good too, even though I don't have the history in place yet. It'll happen.

	  from <a href="http://snarkmarket.com">snarkmarket</a>: 

<blockquote>Neil deGrasse Tyson likes to point out how it’s a mathematical cer­tainty that the air we breathe and the water we drink passed through the lungs and kidneys (respectively) of every one who ever lived. Like­wise, in these Civil War photos, both the destroyed Southern build­ings (one of them a US army fort) and the Northern cannons that destroyed them result from the profits of American slavery. Amer i­cans like to think about victories in World War II with out thinking about the cities and people destroyed in Russia and dozens of other countries (including Japan, Italy, and Germany) that stand behind that war — in no small part because we don’t have to live with them, to walk down those streets, to feel those ghosts. But we’re haunted all the same.</blockquote>

I just had to repost that- I love the idea of the past as ghosts, haunting us, unescapable. Shades of Robert Pirsig- we're the sum of all the ghosts of the past. Not all of them are bad, luckily.
