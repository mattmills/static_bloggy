	  <p>The first pic isn&#8217;t from the fair, but it&#8217;s only fair to put it in, because she got me in. As in Mckenzie bought my ticket. The fair at night isn&#8217;t much different than the fair during the day, except that the crackhead-looking carnies are actually on crack, and not just fiending. There&#8217;s another post from my daytime runs at the fair coming up, too. As soon as I finish with those photos, that is&#8230;</p>

	  <p>So, this took a very long time, to cover the distance between these two photos. Not a lot to say, really. Gonna have to go back to make up for the three weeks I missed.</p>

	  <p>over on warren ellis&#8217; <a href="http://warrenellis.com">blog</a>, he does these, and well, I&#8217;m just doing this one so that those of you who follow me in cyberspace only (and who haven&#8217;t heard from me since I got back) that I&#8217;m alive and well. Egypt was cut short because of some illness requiring a brief hospitalization, after which I was right as rain, but which completely drained my funds, destroying the fine balance I had between making money and spending it. So I had to come back early. I also now owe my mother a fortune, even though she says I don&#8217;t. there will be state fair pictures soon, and plans are hatching for more adventures.</p>

	  <p>It&#8217;s wonderfully quiet here. I&#8217;ve only been here an hour and I&#8217;m already more relaxed. Got a meal, got my room, a shower, etc, etc. Internets is spotty and costly here. We&#8217;ll see if they change the password on me or what. Might just be incommunicado for a few days. Put the &#8220;get away&#8221; in get away from it all.</p>
<p>Meantime, bus rides are boring, except when there are pretty things to photograph out the windows. I can&#8217;t complain. The Sinai is pretty rad looking. Erm&#8230; yeah. not a lot to say. Photos! Yeah! Look:</p>
