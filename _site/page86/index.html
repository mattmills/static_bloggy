For a dude like me, who doesn't have normal, that means it was extra special. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >A little taste of ISO 25,000. THIS IS HOW REAL MEN TAKE PICTURES.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />(edit out long drawn out account of room cleaning, wheel building, and finally bike tube acquisition, which was crazy to do, but after writing it out, boring to tell). <br /><br /><span class="caption" >These two old dudes were just sitting togetther mooning over each other in a loud bar filled with people a third their age. Aww.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then there was booze cruise and Sauced and Hi lo, and hanging out at Erin/Colby's place, with some random Cmay thrown in just because my night wasn't interesting enough already. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >People always do this. Not usually in triplicate, though.<br /></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />On a random somewhat tangentially related note (but who wants boring details?) I realized last night that I like philosophies that allow me to do nothing and reap benefits for it. That's all. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Bike ride?

	  You know that story about how some monasteries require applicants to stand outside and wait for three days before they can enter? After a semester of teaching a bunch of kids who are just there to fill in a blank on their degree rubric, I understand that now. So many people aren't in college to learn, they're there to buy a piece of paper. And when you expect them to do more than sit there in class and stare at the wall, they balk. Sometimes there's one or two good students, but they're the exception. It would be nice if we could limit our students to those who wanted to learn. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Dinner on no diet day. Gotta love it.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grill.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Oh well. I'll never be an ancient sage of anything, either, and I'm not taking another teaching job, unless it's teaching photography as art. I'll never forget the blank faces I got after showing my students "La Jetee." It wasn't that they didn't understand the film, they had just ignored it. Anyway, the sun is shining, the outside is gorgeous, and I'm off.

	  from <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/05/an_expectation.html">Schneier</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>... Twenty years ago, if someone wanted to look through your correspondence, he had to break into your house. Now, he can just break into your ISP. Ten years ago, your voicemail was on an answering machine in your office; now it's on a computer owned by a telephone company. Your financial accounts are on remote websites protected only by passwords; your credit history is collected, stored, and sold by companies you don't even know exist.<br /><br />And more data is being generated. Lists of books you buy, as well as the books you look at, are stored in the computers of online booksellers. Your affinity card tells your supermarket what foods you like. What were cash transactions are now credit card transactions. What used to be an anonymous coin tossed into a toll booth is now an EZ Pass record of which highway you were on, and when. What used to be a face-to-face chat is now an e-mail, IM, or SMS conversation -- or maybe a conversation inside Facebook.</blockquote>

	  I took my camera to the grocery store. I have an idea: to make interesting pictures when nothing is happening. It's a weird personal barrier I have, a switch that is either on or off in my head; if it doesn't seem to me like anything is happening, then nothing is. Of course, something is always happening, "the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock."
