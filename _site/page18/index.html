	  <p>over on warren ellis&#8217; <a href="http://warrenellis.com">blog</a>, he does these, and well, I&#8217;m just doing this one so that those of you who follow me in cyberspace only (and who haven&#8217;t heard from me since I got back) that I&#8217;m alive and well. Egypt was cut short because of some illness requiring a brief hospitalization, after which I was right as rain, but which completely drained my funds, destroying the fine balance I had between making money and spending it. So I had to come back early. I also now owe my mother a fortune, even though she says I don&#8217;t. there will be state fair pictures soon, and plans are hatching for more adventures.</p>

	  <p>It&#8217;s wonderfully quiet here. I&#8217;ve only been here an hour and I&#8217;m already more relaxed. Got a meal, got my room, a shower, etc, etc. Internets is spotty and costly here. We&#8217;ll see if they change the password on me or what. Might just be incommunicado for a few days. Put the &#8220;get away&#8221; in get away from it all.</p>
<p>Meantime, bus rides are boring, except when there are pretty things to photograph out the windows. I can&#8217;t complain. The Sinai is pretty rad looking. Erm&#8230; yeah. not a lot to say. Photos! Yeah! Look:</p>

	  <p>So today I did a bad thing. I had dinner at Pizza Hut. But! I timed it so I would be right by the Nile, so I could see the sunset over the world&#8217;s longest river, and take some pictures. Here:</p>

	  <p>yeah, I know, more street pictures. I could do this all month, if I weren&rsquo;t sick of Cairo. Really, really tired. noise. Cars. Crossing the road. No food in the day, because of Ramadan. A week at the beach is just what the doctor ordered. Yeah: </p>

<p>Also, sunset pictures coming soon. Over the freakin&rsquo; nile. </p>

	  <p>seriously, the traffic here is something else. It&#8217;s a big part of what I&#8217;ll take away from here. I&#8217;ll have dreams of the sound of horns and weaving through crowds of pedestrians. Also, crossing the street here is a bitch and a half. The cars in that first picture? Stopped. Then they move a few feet, then they stop again.</p>

<p>If I were a fruit-lover I&#8217;d be set:</p>

<p>Hipshot foot-traffic.</p>

<p>Up next, though, we have the antithesis of this: at 7AM, the streets are empty and the light is wonderful. I&#8217;m getting ready to move on from Cairo though. I found out about a really nice beach in a place called Dahab, in the southern Sinai. Cheap Too. I think what I might do is go there for a week and then come back here for a couple days (however long it takes to get my flight arranged) and then head back to the <span class="caps">OKC</span>. That means I&#8217;ll be back around the 20th. That&#8217;s two weeks earlier than I thought I&#8217;d be coming home, but I think I&#8217;ll need that time to make money. Gotta eat, gotta pay rent, etc. Meantime: Gotta rock out. Laters.</p>
