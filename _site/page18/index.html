	  <p>So today I did a bad thing. I had dinner at Pizza Hut. But! I timed it so I would be right by the Nile, so I could see the sunset over the world&#8217;s longest river, and take some pictures. Here:</p>

<p>Definitely worth it.</p>

	  <p>yeah, I know, more street pictures. I could do this all month, if I weren&rsquo;t sick of Cairo. Really, really tired. noise. Cars. Crossing the road. No food in the day, because of Ramadan. A week at the beach is just what the doctor ordered. Yeah: </p>

	  <p>seriously, the traffic here is something else. It&#8217;s a big part of what I&#8217;ll take away from here. I&#8217;ll have dreams of the sound of horns and weaving through crowds of pedestrians. Also, crossing the street here is a bitch and a half. The cars in that first picture? Stopped. Then they move a few feet, then they stop again.</p>

<p>If I were a fruit-lover I&#8217;d be set:</p>

<p>Hipshot foot-traffic.</p>

<p>Up next, though, we have the antithesis of this: at 7AM, the streets are empty and the light is wonderful. I&#8217;m getting ready to move on from Cairo though. I found out about a really nice beach in a place called Dahab, in the southern Sinai. Cheap Too. I think what I might do is go there for a week and then come back here for a couple days (however long it takes to get my flight arranged) and then head back to the <span class="caps">OKC</span>. That means I&#8217;ll be back around the 20th. That&#8217;s two weeks earlier than I thought I&#8217;d be coming home, but I think I&#8217;ll need that time to make money. Gotta eat, gotta pay rent, etc. Meantime: Gotta rock out. Laters.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2010/09/07/cairo-in-the-morning.html">Cairo in the morning</a></h2>
	  <p>Compared to andy other time of the day, the streets in Cairo are empty in the morning, about 6am. I say about because I&#8217;m not entirely sure of when this was. There&#8217;s been some confusion about daylight savings time. I&#8217;ve spent today in front of the computer, except for the half hour walk I took this morning, in the quiet. Programming and thinking and playing games. Man I need to get outta this room. Maybe go walk around. Down to the Museum, even though it&#8217;s closed.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2010/09/06/the-great-pyramid-of-giza.html">The Great Pyramid of Giza</a></h2>
	  <p>yesterday, I went to the pyramids, fulfilling my tourist quota for this entire trip, and maybe even for my eventual recovery trip to St. Louis (Stuart: I would kill half a dozen men for a pizza-pie from blackthorn. Just name names. <span class="caps">THERE</span> IS NO <span class="caps">REAL</span> <span class="caps">PIZZA</span> <span class="caps">HERE</span>).</p>
<p>Ahem. Anyway, I went with the same kiwi I&#8217;d met yesterday, good guy. Walked around in the heat of the morning (not nearly as bad as you&#8217;d expect) and in total spent about $20 (100 Egyptian pounds). I&#8217;d been told previously that it was rather more expensive to get into the site, so I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, I could have paid more to go into one of the pyramids, and more to go into the temple next to sphinx, and more again for a guide, souvenirs, and refreshments, but as I had my water, knew enough about the pyramids already, and the only souvenir I wanted was a bit of sand, I was satisfied just to go and see and look.</p>
<p>About that: Don&#8217;t be an asshole. I say this because I was tempted to be like Anthony Bourdain and skip the pyramids altogether. That would have been a mistake. They are, in a word, magnificent. Skyscrapers are cool, and much taller, and arguably superior in a lot of other ways, but man, these things are <em>impressive</em>. I&#8217;ve tried to convey the scale in the pictures below, but it&#8217;s hard. Scale like that doesn&#8217;t fit easily into a frame (it&#8217;s interesting to note how well the city-scale of things here seems to fit in my viewfinder though).</p>
<p>A note about the location: The town ends abruptly at the pyramids, and on the other side, from the looks of it, there is only desert. Amazing how the city would have such sharp borders.</p>
<p>Anyway yeah. I&#8217;m going to shut up and show you the pictures. The photo of me is by Mr. Kim (not his last name, but whatever). Annoying tourists are annoying, with all the silly things they do.</p>
