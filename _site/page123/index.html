	  <h2><a href="/2008/04/17/on-being-an-artist.html">On being an artist...</a></h2>
	  So, my blog hero (because everybody needs something to aspire to) posted about <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2008/04/if-children-are-to-learn-anything-about.htm">telling kids to be an artist</a>. I want to say, here and now, being an artist isn't all million dollar paintings and getting hot babes. Those are side effects, and not everybody gets 'em. Some of us are still broke our whole lives, just doing it because there isn't anything else we can do. <br /><br />It ain't easy being an artist. There are always haters. Critics. People who see something good and just want to tear it down. The hard part is knowing when they're right and you suck and when you gotta just shake 'em off, and the answer is, they're always wrong. You know your faults better than anyone, they don't know shit.<br /><br />Don't be an artist for the money. Don't do it for chicks, or for the image. Most artists don't have an image. The best ones are sort of humble and bashful when you try and tell them they're good. Don't be an artist because it gives you license. If you need a license, it isn't art. If you have to do it, if there's no way to stop whatever it is that comes out of you, that's art. You can't make art because you want to, you do it because you have to, because that little voice inside won't let you live and breathe and be at peace unless you're creating. You do it and do it and do it, and if you're lucky you know some people who get it, and if you're really really lucky some of those people will pay for it. <br /><br />Don't be an artist unless you have a fanatically strong stubborn streak. The real test isn't who's selling for millions at the Tate or the Met or Southeby's, but who sticks to their guns, never admits failure, even though they've gotta take a shit job at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_(novel)">Post Office</a> to cover the bills, they still do it, they turn that into their art. <br /><br />It's not good going crazy, having stupid sleeping disorders that make it impossible to  hold a regular job for more than 6 months, that make you want to run screaming into the night chasing after whoknowswhat. It's a special kind of madness, and it takes a huge wack of talent not to end up in the nuthouse walking that razorwire tightrope. <br /><br />And there's no net. Inevitably you fall. Sometimes you flap your arms on the way down and hope, and sometimes because you are that creative motherfucker, because you belong up there, flying, you grow those wings, and astound the world.  <br /><br />So, if you wanna be an artist, bust it out or go back to school and find a nice safe life. This isn't nice and it isn't safe and it isn't stable. Here there be sleepless nights and crazy manic 72 hour sessions in the studio and the only way you can keep it together is because there's no other way for you to be. <br /><br />On the other hand, artist chicks are hotter.

	  no, not really. No men have ever come out of Nantucket. /nonsense<br /><br />But seriously, it's been a good couple of days. I'm getting editors all on the same page, all but one of us has a section we're responsible for, and things are going well in general for gestalt. Gestalt is the magazine I'm starting that anyone can write for. <br /><br />Let's see, where did we leave off? Last Friday, I think it was. So, on friday, I woke up sore, sometime around three in the afternoon. did some vague things around the house, found the photos I've been promising Sabrina for forever, went over to Frankie's  house to give them to her and hang out. Hung out there for a while, drank some beers. Talked a little about religion, and little innocent me, I just sat there with my mouth shut while dude was talking about his male christian conception of god, and how that was natural and innate in all of us. Sometimes it's better to just shut your mouth, and this was one of those times, because besides that little hitch, dude was pretty cool. <br /><br />Let's see, other than that... had a boring saturday. Finally went to bed at around 4am, got up at 8:30. Blueberry muffins for breakfast, then we went to sams, where we bought a bed for my dad finally. Which means I have my room back. <br /><br />Lets say that again: I HAVE MY ROOM BACK! YAY! Hey, if I can't shout from my stupid blog, where can I shout from?<br /><br />So yeah, got most of my stuff into the room, organized a little, then I had to do yard work for a while. Mow grass and clear sticks and such. My knees are killing me today, but the rest of me is all right. <br /><br />After that, 'cause we haven't seen each other in a few days, I went out to get coffee with Lora and hang out for a bit. She was in a weird mood, really distant. I was no help, because I was really happy about the room and talking to Jess earlier. I have a feeling what's wrong for Lora, but if I say it out loud it won't be true, even if it is. I was really tired while we were walking, from the yard work, and pulled out my phone to check it. I had to stare at it for a minute to make sense of what it was saying. Then I put it away, and Lora said something, I forget what, and I explained that I just couldn't make sense of the phone, had to stare at it for a second, but it still wouldn't resolve into something that I understood. And she said, yeah, I'm having one of those moments with my life right now. So yeah, I hope she's all right. <br /><br />And after that, all I did was come home and drink bourbon. Despite my usual bad luck with that particular liquor, I was fine, finally went to bed at a reasonable time after almot two weeks of being fully nocturnal. Of course, then I woke up at 4:30 am. Now, pictures.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/04/12/broke-and-still-getting-out.html">broke and still getting out...</a></h2>
	  It's good to have friends. It's even better to have friends that are close enough that they don't give a shit that you're broke, they want you to come out anyway. "You broke? It'sa no problem!" (in my best italian accent). <br /><br />Thursday, I woke up and cleaned the kitchen. Then Dillon called, and he was working on his house. Bro is 23, has two houses, has the second hottest girl of anyone I know, doing well for himself. Anyway, he was wondering if maybe I wanted to come over and see the place, and I said, sure. <br /><br />The house is in a depreciated area; not the ghetto, but just a couple blocks north of it. Hardwood floors, rather small really. Nice workshop out back. He was taping off everything in the house that wasn't getting painted, and me being me, I picked up a roll of tape and helped. <br /><br />After about 6 hours of that, we went to this bar over on the north side of town, and damned if I can remember the name. 63rd and may, well, north of 63rd about a hundred yards. The waitress was nice but royally screwed the tabs, and for some reason I couldn't make a shot to save my life. This is different from my normal pool playing, where I can hold my own. <br /><br />From there, when the bar closed, there was the required beer stop and then a very fast drive to an apartment where two of the guys that were with us at the bar lived. For some reason a lot of these kids drive souped up cars. Anyway, one of the guys is a chef, and he produced a morel mushroom, which I had to try. When a chef at a five star tells you something is the best, it's a rule, you've gotta try it. (I once wrote a long essay about trusting good cooks, even if it isn't something you normally are into. I normally don't like mushrooms, for example). And, it was suprisingly good. A little grit, which he ascribed to a brief soaking (5 hours instead of 8). And the he brought out the steak. This delicious, amazing steak, super tender. Nrmally part of the ribeye, he said, and he sells them for $75 bucks a pop at his restaurant. As h'ors d'oeuvre with friends playing video games. Fucking awesome. <br /><br />Oh yeah, what was everyone doing while noshing on that deliciousness? Playing Rock Band, a game that takes conspicuous consumption to a whole new level, and is really fun looking in the process. They played the game, I took pictures. It worked out. Next time on Five Years: Pictures, and what I did with my friday...

	  And by again, I mean for the first time. Hi everyone, even you people who were looking for "Matt Mills porn" in google. No porn here, just good clean photography. While I might occaisionally take pictures of scantily clad women, naked ones even (although that hasn't happened in a while; other things to do when I get naked with a girl, you know), there's no porn here, and don't hold your breath. Seriously, it's a little weird that someone is searching my name with porn. Could be worse. They could be searching "Matt Mills assassination."<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />It's been a good couple of days. <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.html">Tony</a> keeps on rocking out, although some easy to find permalinks would be nice. The top and third posts as of this writing, about needing to write every day, are awesome, the reason I keep going back to his blog, even when he's dragging, even when some weeks he only posts about shit I don't want to hear. Because in 7 years reading his blog, he's been consistently pulling out awesome writing like that, sooner or later. And all the hotchicks, I'm not gonna lie.<br /><br />So, the good news is that I'm doing all right. Several good things have happened to me in the last 24 hours. I had a primo steak for dinner, fresh french fries, all delicious. I then went and had coffee with Lora and Sabrina, two friends of mine, both of whom I owe pictures, sorry girls, I swear I'm on it right after I write this. Lora had to go home and sleep, she works, and I can't decide if I'm jealous of her having a job, you know, with income, or if I'm glad I'm not tied down like that, needing to be in bed by a certain time. Although that never stopped me from staying up before.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />So, that left me and Sabrina to run around town a bunch. Sabrina's an old friend, from high school, but I haven't seen her since last fall, so we had a bit of catching up to do. We talked for a while, drove around some, and got out and walked some too. The photos are from the walking and the driving. Yes, I take photos even when I'm driving sometimes. I do it really fast, and I never leave my lane, although sometimes a little swerving is involved. So yeah, we walked and talked, and before you know it it was 11:30 and Sabrina's husband was calling and asking where his wife was, and so we ambled back to the car and I took her home.<br /><br />Then I went home and read for a while. <a href="http://www.johndiesattheend.com/">John Dies at the End</a>  is a really cool story. A little disconnected at times, but worth reading. Really scary at points, too, something that few stories do for me. To answer the riddle at the beginning: No. By the way, the title is deceptive. That's all I'm saying.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />OK, so with that out of the way, I gotta go do up the photos. Peace everyone/MAtt
