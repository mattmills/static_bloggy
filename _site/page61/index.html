	  so, I was thinking about twitter... and social media in general... a mistake most so-called experts make is thinking of little updates as <span >broadcasting</span>, when really it's <span >backchannel</span>. You have a hundred twitter followers that also follow you, you're inside that circle of people, messaging them things that are irrelevant or unimportant to the rest of the world, but that they might find useful/entertaining/funny. Non-sequiturs. The useful information that you get from the chatter are the things you wouldn't have found otherwise. Most importantly, it's <span >behind the scenes</span>. <br /><br />That's true for most twitter users, I'd bet. Then there are the "experts" who think of twitter as a place to sell stuff; it's a free way to shout things about your product, after all. The problem is, when seen in the light of the above: all advertising on twitter is effectively noise. If your product is good, it will get word of mouth (actually, you'll get more word of mouth if it's bad or easy to make fun of; see snuggies, slap-chop, etc.).

	  I haven't been posting. I have a shit ton of photos, and they're all uploaded now, so my only excuse is that I'm usually pretty tired of the computer at the end of the day and don't have the energy to write a whole lot or stare at the screen for an extra hour or two to put something together. <br /><br />Anyway, these rae from the beginning photo class I taught at OKCCoCo - I only had four people show up, so it was a little bit of a letdown, but at least I was able to answer some questions and maybe the people learned some things. I said a lot, I know that much.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  fuck it. I was going to write something but instead I cut it because let's face it, even I don't want to listen to my bullshit long enough to write it. The photos, though, I could stare at for hours... not that I do, you think I have time for that? no, I'm to busy doing your mothers. All of them, alphabetically. I'm all the way to 'c' now.

	  1. Getting ready for the first Oklahoma Citizen meeting wednesday-yes, the newspaper has a name, tentatively. I need to make an agenda, decide what I'm going to say, maybe put together a powerpoint, etc. etc. It's a lot of prep work.<br /><br />2. Laundry- I wore one clean sock today and one dirty sock. Enough said. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />3. House Cleaning- literally. My room has once more transformed into a series of piles, and the bathroom hasn't been scrubbed in a couple weeks. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />4. Physical therapy exercises- these take about ten minutes, and I'll probably do them right after I get done writing this. <br /><br />5. Promote <a href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/909837">my book</a>. Done. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />6. Process some of the pictures from the last few weeks. (The ones you're seeing here are from just after halloween. I have a bunch still in the camera from after that even). <br /><br />And that's it. My todo list for right now. What I should be doing. Instead, I'm waiting on a phone call to go out and celebrate somebody's birthday. No names, I am a gentleman after all. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/11/05/whats-next.html">what's next?</a></h2>
	  this is always on my mind. For a very long time, I've been casting about, trying to find my way through the world, and it's been a ripping good time. I've got a good job now, one that will eventually afford me a great deal of freedom, assuming I don't get tied down with a wife and kids and mortgage and all the trappings of modern life that are really just a trap. <br /><br />It's a curve though. I'm starting at zero: zero knowledge of the stuff I'm doing, zero time to do anything but sleep and work, zero money, and zero photos taken since I started the job on tuesday. these will all help each other though: As I learn the job, I'll have more time to get out and do things; as soon as I have a paycheck, I'll have more money in hand than I've had in months; and of course, there will be more photos. (I just checked; there are a couple photos on the camera, but nothing of consequence). <br /><br />one thing, I guess: I've realized that you don't have to be all one thing; that is, you can do a lot of different things, do them well, and it's not that you're letting go of one thing for another, it's that you're able to do both, and that all of your activities inform one another. It's a good thing I've come to this realization, because it's a really bad time to be trying to make money off of photography. (I'm not going to go into details, but someone was pissed at me recently because they thought I was putting out a certain photo for a profit, and it made me laugh. I've never made money off of what I consider my real work, the portraits, the documentary projects, etc).
