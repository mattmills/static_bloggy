	  Here I am, it's morning, hello everyone. Been a bit since I rapped at ya, been busy. Every thing is up in the air, and with a little luck, I'll keep it all that way. All china and razor blades, flying around my head, propelled there by me.<br /><br />I'm so incredibly stoked about Gestalt it's not even funny. Every single one of the editors are singularly amazing, and I'm glad as hell they're working with me. Hey, sometimes to get the best people all you have to do is ask them. We had our first meeting on tuesday, and it was a blast. They've all got great ideas, and they're on board for the direction I'd like to see the magazine go in, in terms of how it's run and whatnot. So that's great. Deadline for the first issue is next wednesday.<br /><br />I haven't been wandering about as much of late, mostly because my longtime wandering partner has been busy. Today, though, there is the arts fest, which should be great. I'm gonna go down and see what kind of trouble I can get myself into. now, photos.<br /><br />When I saw these pieces of pipe cut, I thought they must have a macine to make the edges so even; turns out that's just how well my dad can use a torch.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />This is the dude that won, TIG welding.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Georgie, waiting for the winners to be announced.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />And the Winner is...

More stuff amd more interesting photos later.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/04/20/weird-situations.html">Weird situations...</a></h2>
	  They seem to just keep cropping up. I'm up to my eyes in weird shit lately. First there was my case of the weirds last thursday (or was it friday? I'm too lazy to check), then there was the apprenticeship contest saturday, then there was a beauty pageant saturday night, and now Lora's not answering texts, even though we were supposed to have an editors meeting. Strange but true.<br /><br />First, the apprenticeship contest. My dad asked me Friday morning if I wanted to go and photograph, ,and I said of course. I got up at 4am,  after about 5 hours of sleep,  and went to teh union school, where the contest was to be held. 90% of the guys that even bothered to be in the competition wee idiots. Every time I walked into the plumbing room, where all tha various plumbing tasks were happening, I got looks from about half the guys, like they didn't want me to be there. Oh well, I got my pictures.<br /><br />I hope Mike likes 'em, though he told my dad in no unncertain terms that I was in the program. Just as I find out I have the opportunity to do photography (boring, mind-numbing photography, though), I have a sure job doing something else, something interesting. Hard work, sure, but there isn't a job in the world worth doing that isn't difficult in some way.<br /><br />So there's that, and then there was this pageant. Mom's friend Georgie from work had her daughter  in the Miss Hispanic UCO pageant, and she won. And since mom didn't want to go alone, and I think wild horses couldn't have dragged dad out to something like that, I went.<br /><br />The organization of the program was shit, the MC was laughably bad, stuck to the script to thte detriment of the show, etc, etc. On the plus side, there were three very attractive ladies posing in also attractive outfits (including swimsuits), dancing four our entertainment, etc. Which made it a worthwhile outing. Now I've been at two major events in this girl's life, her quincinera, and now this pageant. Georgie had me come and photograph at the quincinera about four years ago.<br /><br />And from there I went home and to bed. Weird dreams that I can't remember. I made brunch. eggs and bacon and home fries.<br /><br />Grocery store with mom, dinner, out for coffee. Still reading don q, and it gets better as it goes. That's all Ive got for now. pics to follow when I feel like it later.

	  Which means, that along with the other 5D I had and shot over 7,000 pictures with, I've shot more photos with this camera than any I've ever owned, since last August. Lightroom has the number of photos I've taken since I got back from brazil at a staggering 14,000. That's 389 rolls of film, at $4/roll, plus 4 for dev costs... $3112 that I haven't spent on film. Of course, I've spent far more than that on cameras, but really, who's to say that I would've had better luck with film cameras? Anyway, this is all just idle speculation. Now, some pictures. This is the lens that inspired the title of the post about being an artist....<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog419-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog419-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />This woman was feeding the ducks.

A photo-project, an essay to commit myself to. More later, when I've had more time to think.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/04/18/today-couldnt-get-better.html">Today couldn't get better...</a></h2>
	  Well, it could, actually, but I don't think it's possible within the bounds of physics and or psychology. My lady, who could improve the situation, is 600 miles away, and there aren't any others. Did I mention the amazing French wine I got for ten bucks? Cote du rhone, no less. <br /><br />Today started out really excellently. I woke up at 2am after 12 hours of sleep, more than I've gotten in almost a week. Then, I read some Don Quixote. Really, if you haven't read this book, you should. Not only for the hilarious moments, but for the ones in which you begin to wonder what is real and what isn't.<br /><br />Coffee with the 'rents. Always a pleasure. Dad wants me to photograph at the Apprentice contest tomorrow. So, I'm getting up at 5am to go shoot pictures. So what else is new?<br /><br />Then he and my mom go off to work, and I get glued to this short story collection, <a href="http://lcrw.net/kessel/">The Baum Plan for Financial Independence by John Kessel</a>. Link goes to a free download page, because sometimes the good things just fly into your hands. <br /><br />So, I pry myself away from the story and head out for adventure. Then I realize I left my outgoing mail on the corner of the desk, so I pull a u turn and go back for it. Then, back on track for adventure. Wherever the wind, my short supply of gas, and my legs will take me. <br /><br />I parked at Bass Pro Shops downtown, and walked toward the city. I knew there had to be a post drop box somewhere in there. I mean, it's a city, right?<br /><br />So I'm walking. I get through Bricktown, which is the entertainment district, and I'm in and among the few skyscrapers OKC has. None are terribly tall, but we at least have an honest skyline. Well, viewed from the east anyway. it kinda sucks from the west. I passed a hotel, asked a dude in a uniform if he knew where a post box would be. He looked at me like I was crazy, from mars or something, and well, to tell the truth, I felt like I was. <br /><br />Lemme back up a little. As I stepped out of the house, I looked around and everything looked profoundly weird. The trees were trees and the grass was grass and the sky was still that faded hazy blue I know all too well, but it seemed like it shouldn't be that way. It was real as a slap in the face, but it seemed wrong, like false notes. And I didn't shake the feeling until much later in the day. It's not something you get used to so much as ignore until you forget. <br /><br />Anyway, the bellhop didn't know where I coud mail my letters, but the concierge did, told me inside the frist national building, down the escalator, and off to the right. And what sould I find when I followed his directions but a full service post office? Very Nice. <br /><br />So then I walked the tunnels that are under OKC for a little bit. I moved maybe five hundred yards along my route, going first east then north, getting lost, and finally deciding that I sould go to the surface, where I had better bearings. <br /><br />As soon as I was back on the surface, I knew where I was, and struck off in the right direction. The Independent Artists' Alice show was up, and I want to smack whoever curated it in the face. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong. There was some exceptional work in the show, some of it even good photography. But the problem is they let in everybody, so it seemed, and as much as a third was crap, and it didn't ever really gel for me as a show. It was a bunch of individual pieces on the wall, and they were in the same gallery, but there was no unity. I really liked some of the individual pieces, though. I'll throw some up when I throw photos up. <br /><br />Then, since I was just around the corner, I went and got a coffee at Java Dave's and said hello to Lora. She was having a shitty day, too many assholes. To the assholes in the world: Be nice to the people that make your food and drinks, because they have a lot of opportunities to fuck with you and you'll never know about it. <br /><br />From there, I wandered a bit more, then hitched a ride with Lora to my car, and came home. Talked to Dillon, he might have a job doing photo for me. Then I went to the liquor store with my dad, found the aforementioned wine, which I need another glass of. Photos to follow soon.
