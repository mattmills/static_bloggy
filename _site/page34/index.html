Ha. There are so many things that word could mean as a teaser! I could do a poll, what did you think matt mills meant when he said &#8216;out&#8217;? Out of town? Out of his mind? How do you feel about me talking about myself in the third person?

	  <p>So, last night I had this dream that I got to egypt and somehow had forgotten my cameras, all of them, and all I could get was a film camera, and the only film I could find was ISO 100 color film, and 120-size black and white. Thought you&#8217;d like to know that. 
<br/><br/>
Also of note: If you&#8217;re staying at my house and happen to see me before I shower and wake up for a couple hours, I&#8217;m not really human yet. Cro-magnon or something till about noon.

Kurtis: How do you get over someone?<br/><br/>

the only way is to get sloppy with several others. keyword: get. all this moping around, writing poems, feeling the depths of depression, etc - all thats played out. its the road most traveled. its for losers. its for the madding crowd. its for people who revolve their schedules around nickleback. first thing you should do this weekend is get a date, make some moves, and think about las vegas. yes you&#8217;ll feel horrible. but you were gonna feel horrible anyways. at least now when you wake up their will be stale champagne on the nightstand. and if youre lucky, it wont be all that stale.<br/>

so true. and the champagne the next day is never stale if they&#8217;re making mimosas with it. And since I have several exes who read this, all of &#8216;em but you, babe.
