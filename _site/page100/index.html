	  <h2><a href="/2009/01/27/no-way-theyre-really-thinking-about-this-in-oklahoma.html">no way they're really thinking about this in oklahoma</a></h2>
	  in response to some stuff on facebook, about nuclear power in oklahoma, and maybe putting it somewhere out in the desert:<br /><br />the problem is nuclear waste stays dangerous for 10,000 plus years. We're talking geologic time here. There's barely anything manmade left from 10000 years ago, much less a solid intact structure. It's a fool's gambit to put this stuff in a salt mine or inside a mountain because any number of unforeseen events could leak the waste into the biosphere. <br /><br />Of course, the waste is only a small part of the overall problem of radioactivity. People talk about Chernobyl and Three mile island as if they were the only nuclear accidents to ever happen, but actually they happen more frequently than you'd like to think. see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents">wikipedia</a> for more examples, although I'm sure that list is incomplete. These are built by the lowest bidder, remember. <br /><br />"Support in the short term" is like saying ok, a little poison is all right. This stuff is so toxic (before, during and after use) that we build ten foot concrete walls around it, then put more security and perimeters around that, and then beyond that is a line where you don't have to wear a dosimeter any more. There are workers in some facilities who can never leave, because they themselves were irradiated so much that they are toxic to the outside world. (I have a feeling that they don't last long like this).<br /><br />edit to add: <a href="http://newsok.com/proponents-make-case-for-nuclear-in-oklahoma/article/3336983">the article from the oklahoman</a>. Seems there aren't any real plans, just some legislators getting their panties in a bunch. 8 to ten years until they become operational is another problem for an "interim" solution.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/01/26/i-should-be-working-on-the-blook.html">I should be working on the blook</a></h2>
	  And applying for jobs and trying my hardest to come up with the zillions of dollars I owe some silly people who think they're ever going to get any money out of me. As I'm pretty sure I'm never going to get any money out of me, what chance have they got?<br /><br />Anyway, there is a final final edit of pics for the blook, just under fifty pictures, and they're in a sort-of order, so I'm going to mock that shit up and print it off and see what people say. <br /><br />In other news, some lame pictures for your ass:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nothing/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nothing/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />yes, super boring, because the last week was all shot to hell between being in the hospital with my mom's multiple operations and my stomach flu. Isn't the dog cute though? I promise to get out more and take photos this week. Now, page design!
