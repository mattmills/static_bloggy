Yeah, I&#8217;m posting two nearly identical photos. The first one because I think it&#8217;s funny, and the second one because I figure they&#8217;ll want it.

	  Yes, I'm annoyed by my own title.. but I do it because I know so many of you will also be frowning, and that makes me laugh. <br /><br />So I went for a walk, down to Grant's house to make coffee, and he had some interesting news which I'm not sure I can share yet, not the big Ruby news, but something else really cool for him personally. All I can say is damn. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Just another wanderer. "I'll be all right, as long as I have some traction," he told me.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was rush hour, on 23rd street... never seen it this dead at that hour. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And yeah, there was all this white stuff on the ground. god's cocaine party. Mostly sleet, though, not the fine white powder all kids and skiers love. Blowing wind, sleet in my face, and there I was, taking pictures. It's a 15 minute walk that took me about 20 due to detours.  <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >I do love these lights.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Good coffee at Grant's, Then I walked to dinner at Mcnellie's.  I kept drinking after dinner, getting drunk and thinking about hard math problems in my head. I always know I've had a long day at the computer when I'm thinking about math, drunk. (was it three or four pints? I was only there an hour and a half, must have been three). Yeah, Snow and Ice and everything nice. I'm going back to bed. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  <h2><a href="/2010/01/25/i-love-winogrand.html">I love Winogrand</a></h2>
	  From <a href="http://www.americansuburbx.com/2008/01/theory-interview-with-garry-winogrand.html">American Suburb X</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>Interviewer: If you don't like "street photographer," how do you respond to that other Ã¦tiresome phrase', "snapshot aesthetic"?<br /><br />Winogrand: I knew that was coming. That's another stupidity. The people who use the term don't even know the meaning. They use it to refer to photographs they believe are loosely organized, or casually made, whatever you want to call it. Whatever terms you like. The fact is, when they're talking about snapshots they're talking about the family album picture, which is one of the most precisely made photographs. Everybody's fifteen feet away and smiling. The sun is over the viewer's shoulder. That's when the picture is taken, always. It's one of the most carefully made photographs that ever happened. People are just dumb. They misunderstand.</blockquote><br /><br />You should read the whole thing.

	  As usual, these are a week delayed, so from 8 days ago. Sundays up at classics are pretty excellent though. More (and less blurry) pics from this last sunday coming soon, I promise. I just realized that none of these are in classics, which is just where we start, after all, not always where we finish. <br /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Boring club in Bricktown.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Exciting moment in the boring club in bricktown. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Random encounter outside the club.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
