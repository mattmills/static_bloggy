	  So, this is how we brought in the new year, with chicken pot pie and soup and baked goods. I was so full after that lunch, I didn't eat until lunch the next day. Yes, these are cutesy family photos. I DO WHAT I WANT. Nyah. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  Because if I don't just do one big post with these, I'll never get them all out, and that would be a tragedy. These are somewhat random; I find myself going out a lot at night. It's the insomnia more than anything; since I'm going to be up anyway, I figure I might as well not be sitting at home bored to death. And I know I've been saying that I want to get away from the 'photos of drunk friends' (or drunken photos of friends) thing, but here they are again anyway. I drink, I take pictures, it's bound to happen. The last photo Kat took, by the way. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  yeah, the title says it all. I just rode my bike to work, pretty proud of that. The best part: I wasn't once afraid for my life as cars passed. So that's better.

	  <h2><a href="/2010/01/12/back-in-blog.html">Back in Blog</a></h2>
	  Yeah, i had another one of those lulls. Always happens. NYE and the surrounding weeks found me unable to drink without getting massive hangovers and as usual, some depression, which wasn't helped by my inability to shoot photos, so the whole thing kind of spiraled downwards so much so that I don't want to be the man with the camera anymore. This is what I feared the most when I took the programming job; by filling my head with something else, there isn't room for the photography. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Look at this hipster.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Of course, we all know that's bullshit. I'm as much a photographer as I was then, and this is just a temporary setback. I'm gonna get my chops back, by hook or by crook, and all will be well with the world. And for the record, I have taken a few good photos, just not as many as I'd like. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Before the freakin' blizzard, or maybe after. Shit conditions to be out in, though.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
