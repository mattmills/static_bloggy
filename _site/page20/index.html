	  <p>ok, 15 minutes to dash off my thoughts so far:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tripout_egypt/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /></p>
<p>Heathrow is a fucking orwellian labyrinth, complete with lots of fences and bored gaurds and weirdness so that it&#8217;s right in the uncanny valley. The kind of shit that freaks you out a little after 18-24 hours of no sleep and flying. Seriously, I was turned the fuck around just figuring out which terminal I was supposed to get to. You had to go down a long hallway, don stairs, around several bends, onto a bus, up two floors, down another hallway, descend one floor, go through security again, and then you&#8217;re there. But the departures board there doesn&#8217;t show a gate until right before time to board. So you have to wait in this packed shopping mall area (high end stuff, sure, but do I really need a Luis Vuitton or a Rolex while in the middle of an airport?).</p>

<p>About that: Flying kinda sucks. It should be the miracle of flight, wow, soaring, but instead we&#8217;re packed like sardines inside a stuffy, hot tin can. This might have something to do with the broken back last year making sitting for 8+ hours pretty uncomfortable (bordering on painful). I almost lost my watch and flashlight on the flight between Houston and london too. Actually, first I lost the cloth I put in my laptop to keep keyboard marks off the screen, and then I liost my watch reaching for it, and then I lost the flashlight looking for the watch. And a packet of cookies. I spent 2/3rds of the flight watchless and flashlightless, a little nervous that they were gone for good. And My knees were aching, I had a sinus headache from sonome&#8217;s perfume, and my back was acting up for the first time in months and months. In other words, a pretty typical trans-atlantic flight. edit to add: I&#8217;m drafting this again on my last flight, and this one I got a row all to myself. Instant Karma.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tripout_egypt/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /></p>
<p>What else? I&#8217;m smelly, sweaty, and very tired. edit: now just smelly and tired. This flight is much cooler, and I got a reasonable nap in. Now all I have to do is clear customs, hop a city bus to the main train station, and walk five minutes. Then I can rest. After I post this though.</p>
<p>update to the edits: took me four hours to get to my hostel, walking a lot, being lost, etc, etc. That&#8217;ll get written up later though. sleep now.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2010/09/01/addendum-to-the-list.html">addendum to the list</a></h2>
	  <p>So, after compiling the list the other day, I realized there were a few things I left off, and some details I left out. First of all, the towel. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day#Origin">A Towel is very important</a>. Normally, I would take a backpacker&#8217;s towel, which are made out of this microfiber super absorbent material, is smaller than a regular towel, and dries faster. For this trip, I&#8217;m using a shamwow, which is the same material as the more expensive backpacker&#8217;s towels, but cheaper and available everywhere.</p>
<p>The laptop: it kills me to say this, but packing light isn&#8217;t everything. I&#8217;m taking the big one.</p>
<p>Not pictured, but packed: A water filter, which was strongly recommended to me. We&#8217;ll see if I really need it.</p>
<p>And two more things, especially for travel anywhere with mosquitos: A <a href="http://www.sawyerproducts.com/B6B.htm">sawyer extractor</a>, and a bottle of 100% <span class="caps">DEET</span>. The extractor is for use on any kind of bug bite, sting, or even snake bite. The do wonders for itching bites, anyway. The <span class="caps">DEET</span> is to keep from getting bitten when I&#8217;m in an area with a lot of bugs. It works.</p>
<p>And this is what it all looks like:</p>

	  So yeah, photos. It was a great party. I'm blogged out for today.

	  <h2><a href="/2010/08/31/and-then-the-blue-note.html">and then the blue note</a></h2>
	  <p>Since it&#8217;s 6am, and I&#8217;m awake, I might as well blog these pictures. I lied, there&#8217;s one more post of drunk people, at Che&#8217;s birthday party. But they&#8217;re very well done drunk people.</p>
<p>Grammatical aside: does it annoy the hell out of anyone else when someone refers a blog post as just a &#8216;blog&#8217;? Blog isn&#8217;t just a post, it&#8217;s the collective noun for all those posts. Get it right, people.</p>
<p>And because I&#8217;m really bad about leaving tabs open and not hitting publish, it&#8217;s no longer 6am. At least my left arm is working right again. It was all weak earlier because someone slept on it wrong. Not sayin&#8217; who, that&#8217;d be ungentlemanly.</p>
