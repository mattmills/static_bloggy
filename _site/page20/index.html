	  <h2><a href="/2010/09/01/addendum-to-the-list.html">addendum to the list</a></h2>
	  <p>So, after compiling the list the other day, I realized there were a few things I left off, and some details I left out. First of all, the towel. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day#Origin">A Towel is very important</a>. Normally, I would take a backpacker&#8217;s towel, which are made out of this microfiber super absorbent material, is smaller than a regular towel, and dries faster. For this trip, I&#8217;m using a shamwow, which is the same material as the more expensive backpacker&#8217;s towels, but cheaper and available everywhere.</p>
<p>The laptop: it kills me to say this, but packing light isn&#8217;t everything. I&#8217;m taking the big one.</p>
<p>Not pictured, but packed: A water filter, which was strongly recommended to me. We&#8217;ll see if I really need it.</p>
<p>And two more things, especially for travel anywhere with mosquitos: A <a href="http://www.sawyerproducts.com/B6B.htm">sawyer extractor</a>, and a bottle of 100% <span class="caps">DEET</span>. The extractor is for use on any kind of bug bite, sting, or even snake bite. The do wonders for itching bites, anyway. The <span class="caps">DEET</span> is to keep from getting bitten when I&#8217;m in an area with a lot of bugs. It works.</p>
<p>And this is what it all looks like:</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2010/08/31/and-then-the-blue-note.html">and then the blue note</a></h2>
	  <p>Since it&#8217;s 6am, and I&#8217;m awake, I might as well blog these pictures. I lied, there&#8217;s one more post of drunk people, at Che&#8217;s birthday party. But they&#8217;re very well done drunk people.</p>
<p>Grammatical aside: does it annoy the hell out of anyone else when someone refers a blog post as just a &#8216;blog&#8217;? Blog isn&#8217;t just a post, it&#8217;s the collective noun for all those posts. Get it right, people.</p>
<p>And because I&#8217;m really bad about leaving tabs open and not hitting publish, it&#8217;s no longer 6am. At least my left arm is working right again. It was all weak earlier because someone slept on it wrong. Not sayin&#8217; who, that&#8217;d be ungentlemanly.</p>

	  <p>Ah, what would life be without the Hilo, with its drag shows, strong drinks, and occasional free darts? More dignified? Less blurry? Who knows. I&#8217;ve definitely had some memorable nights there, and some nights I&#8217;d rather forget.</p>
<p>A bloggery aside: I&#8217;ve got this post, one more about the blue note, and then it&#8217;s all travel blogging for the next five weeks. Fun and adventure and really wild things. Also very few drunk people. Muslim country and all.</p>

	  <p>This was the same Sunday, that same afternoon. Nice light, a lot of good action with people jumping into the pool. Also, high fives are always appropriate, even in mid air over the pool.</p>
