	  <h2><a href="/2010/11/12/birthday-party.html">birthday party?</a></h2>
	  <p>SO, I&#8217;m pretty sure this was timmy&#8217;s birthday or something&#8230; there was a keg, I remember that, and the european exchange students (not pictured). Also, while cody didn&#8217;t land the pictured trick, he got it on the next try. I just like this photo better.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I once again have a huge backlog of photos ready to blog about. I&#8217;m wishing my blogging software had better scheduling capabilities. I might have to hack on that sometime soon. Or maybe see if there&#8217;s an extension already written. That&#8217;d be cool. Now I have to code all afternoon, finish up with the old job stuff before I have to start the new job stuff on monday. <span class="caps">NEW</span> <span class="caps">JOB</span>, Yay! Anyway, photos:</p>

	  <p>So, yeah. Came home, and then the haloween madness started. Kj drove, which meant I got to sleep, wonderful road-weary sleep, and I woke up and there was a sunset and we were nearly there. I wonder if you know how fucking wonderful that is? A moment of calm and peace, after one set of mad adventures and before the next.</p>

	  <p>The last one is my favorite; something about these guys just indicates a degree of whimsy. Thanks to the old man for the use of his antiques and mirror, thanks to Heather for inviting me and introducing all of us, and thanks to Kyle for the sweet suite (didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d pass that pun up, did you?). There&#8217;s one more b-ville post coming, the road home, which is always sweet, and you shouldn&#8217;t miss, &#8216;cause it&#8217;s got more KJ in it. Probably tomorrow lunch or in the evening, depending on how the day goes.</p>

	  <p>Here I am, trying to sleep, and I can&#8217;t. so I figure I&#8217;ll post something. These are from the shoot that sunday afternoon, with Kyle in Bartlesville. There were a lot of things that were wrong, unprepared-for, and generally hilarious about this shoot, but overall, I can&#8217;t complain, the images look pretty good. This is broken into two posts, just to ease the server load.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2010/10/28/frank-and-lolas-bartlesville-part-1.html">Frank and Lola's (bartlesville part 1)</a></h2>
	  <p>Went to Bartlesville a couple weeks ago, saw the sights, did some things, got into stuff. My friends Heather and Kyle invited me up to see a show, Truckstop Honeymoon, and to shoot Kyle&#8217;s two-man band, er&#8230; not sure what their name is, I&#8217;ll update this when I find out.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are from the frist part of the night I spent there, the time in the bar, the band (truckstop h), this rad little girl who couldn&#8217;t stop hula-hooping, and Kyle and Heather are the sickeningly sweet couple in the last shot. The sweetly engaged-later-that-night couple. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re officially announced to the world, but hey, now they are. Of course, I can&#8217;t think of anyone who reads this who they wouldn&#8217;t want knowing. (As a blogger, I still haven&#8217;t gotten it through my head that people I don&#8217;t know actually read this shit).</p>
