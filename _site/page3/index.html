	  <p>Going over to kj&#8217;s here in a minute to do a photo shoot, not either of the planned ones (that I&#8217;ll have to get off my ass and do here pretty quick, before summer tries to kill us all), but just a test shoot getting ready for a thing in early april. Anyway, photos unrelated:</p>

	  <p>My photos from the first snow storm were a little too depressing&#8230; not in that they were bad, but you can tell looking at them that I feel like shit. Since I feel a lot better now (o hai spring), I&#8217;m leaving them out. But these, from the second storm, are better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, everything is moving along. Haven&#8217;t gotten any closer on planning those shoots I wanted to do. I need to email a bunch of people, I suppose, and gather all the supplies I&#8217;ll need. Lights. A stuffed wolf or puma. A stone spearhead. A stick. Model. Location. Storyboards, maybe even.</p>

	  <p>just a couple photos&#8230; got a bunch more in the queue. It&#8217;s amazing how far behind you get when you start a month behind and then lose the use of your laptop for a week and a half. But enough excuses. I&#8217;m working on a bunch of things&#8230; couple photo shoots coming up hopefully, coding some interesting side projects. I have to wonder: is the extra mental energy spent on coding a drain on my photography? I think it is. If nothing else, there&#8217;s only so much time in a day. I don&#8217;t sleep much. Oh well. That&#8217;s what the coffee obsession is for.</p>
<p>Speaking of, this was a really enlightening day. It was down at Elemental&#8217;s new Alley Bar, which is, as I&#8217;ve written before, pretty amazing. I learned a lot about espresso blending and what exactly goes into it. A lot of coffee was drank. One blend had the distinct flavor of peanut shells, I&#8217;ll never forget it. But the real blend, what we came out with, was amazing. Lots of complexity and goodness. I wish more coffee shops in town used Elemental. Actually, scratch that: I wish less shops in town used Neighbors. I wish some of them would actually taste good coffee and think about what they&#8217;re serving. &lt;/rant&gt; Anyway, this was a pleasure. They&#8217;re open limited hours in the mornings right now, but totally worth getting up a little early to get to.</p>

	  <p>It&#8217;s been a long week and a half actually. Broken laptop and hospital time and exhaustion and stress. But on the other hand: drinking and good times and great friends and new beautiful women. really, I&#8217;ll take what I can get. and now I&#8217;m back on the air, everybody&#8217;s healthy (knock on wood) and my lappy is more or less restored. Done and done. <br />
