	  <h2><a href="/2011/03/30/broken-social-scene.html">broken social scene</a></h2>
	  <p>went out to tulsa, got to see a really good show. Broken social sceneplayed. I&#8217;d heard <span class="caps">BSS</span> at parties, on the spy, etc, and a bunch of friends were going. So I went, not quite on a whim, but only with a couple days notice. Good show, good brunch the day after. I was sad that I didn&#8217;t even try to take my camera into the venue. A friend told me that they weren&#8217;t letting people with cameras in and so I didn&#8217;t try; turns out they didn&#8217;t care. And I could have been in the front row, too. Oh well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my photographic output has dropped from little to nothing. had a bad shoot with KJ and just haven&#8217;t shot a thing in the week and a half since. It&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s fault, really, that the shoot went badly. I should have seen that what were doing wouldn&#8217;t work, though. It&#8217;s like I need to completely start from scratch and learn to shoot pictures all over again, and forget all the things I&#8217;ve learned. Throw away 13 years of experience and start fresh. Or maybe it&#8217;s a change of scene that I need; I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll figure something out.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2011/03/22/ok-nobody-move-this-is-a-robbery.html">ok nobody move this is a robbery</a></h2>
	  <p>er, something like that. a drive by blogging, maybe. Quick and painless as long as nobody tries to be a hero, OK?</p>
<p>Shoot from the other day went ok. Not brilliant or life changing but some decent photos. This is another thing I do: I hate everything I&#8217;ve shot until at least a week after I shot it. Sometimes more like a month. This is why I&#8217;m such a procrastinator. It takes me a month get it out of my system that I suck and just put the photos out there.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got a new domain, <a href="http://photounrelated.com">photounrelated.com</a>, that points here for now but might point to a new blog, or I might rename this one and start using that domain, I&#8217;m not sure. I&#8217;m always writing about one thing and showing photos from another.</p>
<p>This night had a color phase and then a black and white phase. It went that way because, as I&#8217;ve said before, the Drunken Fry is badly lit. Or at least very dimly lit. Weird night, anyway.</p>

	  <p>Going over to kj&#8217;s here in a minute to do a photo shoot, not either of the planned ones (that I&#8217;ll have to get off my ass and do here pretty quick, before summer tries to kill us all), but just a test shoot getting ready for a thing in early april. Anyway, photos unrelated:</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2011/03/17/snow-x2.html">snow x2</a></h2>
	  <p>My photos from the first snow storm were a little too depressing&#8230; not in that they were bad, but you can tell looking at them that I feel like shit. Since I feel a lot better now (o hai spring), I&#8217;m leaving them out. But these, from the second storm, are better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, everything is moving along. Haven&#8217;t gotten any closer on planning those shoots I wanted to do. I need to email a bunch of people, I suppose, and gather all the supplies I&#8217;ll need. Lights. A stuffed wolf or puma. A stone spearhead. A stick. Model. Location. Storyboards, maybe even.</p>
