	  Like something out of a sci-fi novel, I came home and found myself already in my bed. What the hell?<br /><br />"Hey, what are you doing here?"<br /><br />Other me sat up in bed. "I'm here from the future. I need to tell you something very important."<br /><br />"What? ok, you're from the future. What kind of day will I have tommorow, so I know you're on the level?"<br /><br />"You'll wake up, go pick up lora for sodas, go have the meeting with only three editors, and then... well, that's what i'm here to-"<br /><br />And then he dissappeared. Yeah, this didn't really happen. I just didn't feel like putting up pictures right now, feeling lazy. have fun without me, internet.

	  Yep, the last week has been a doozy. Let's see... I started out with a hangover and cold. I decided to build a camera, and to get everyone else in the world to help me. www.opensourcecamera.org. I also finally got around to starting that magazine, called Gestalt, www.gestaltnews.com. I took some photos, wandered around a bit. Talked to Lora some, maybe straightened out some things with her. Haven't talked to Jess, though, hopefully she'll get back to me soon. I had a nice day driving around today, anyway. I'm gonna let the pictures tell the rest.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-1.jpg"><img style="" 0px="" auto="" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Elaine's new installation...<br><br><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>At the bar<br><br><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>I don't think he likes me.

	  So I saw this alley, and couldn't resist walking down it. <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-8.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-8.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />There was all this great graf, looked fresh, not faded.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-7.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />And this is just a random cross I saw by the side of the road.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/03/15/time-to-explain-myself.html">time to explain myself</a></h2>
	  My last blog was 100k of fun in the sun, a blog about my time in Santa Fe, and supposedly about paying off my loans. I stopped blogging there when I decided I just didn't have time for it any more, and nobody was reading. But now I'm at home, and I'm about to enter into a five year long apprenticeship program, in pipefitting, which is how to weld pipe, any kind, any metal, plastic, anything. At the end of the five years, I'll have all my debts paid off and a decent amount of savings. Which means I'll probably hit the road. The vagabond lifestyle for a while. The good thing about being a pipefitter is that there's enough work, plenty of money to live on and save, and plenty of time between jobs to go places if I want to. So this is a blog about my life learning to be a pipefitter and still being a photographer at the same time. I don't think I could ever stop taking pictures; not having it as an income stream just sets me free to make the pictures I want to make. Of course, that makes it more difficult when they're halfway around the world, but I'll figure that out when I get there.
