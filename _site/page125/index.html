	  My last blog was 100k of fun in the sun, a blog about my time in Santa Fe, and supposedly about paying off my loans. I stopped blogging there when I decided I just didn't have time for it any more, and nobody was reading. But now I'm at home, and I'm about to enter into a five year long apprenticeship program, in pipefitting, which is how to weld pipe, any kind, any metal, plastic, anything. At the end of the five years, I'll have all my debts paid off and a decent amount of savings. Which means I'll probably hit the road. The vagabond lifestyle for a while. The good thing about being a pipefitter is that there's enough work, plenty of money to live on and save, and plenty of time between jobs to go places if I want to. So this is a blog about my life learning to be a pipefitter and still being a photographer at the same time. I don't think I could ever stop taking pictures; not having it as an income stream just sets me free to make the pictures I want to make. Of course, that makes it more difficult when they're halfway around the world, but I'll figure that out when I get there.

	  Seriously. I've been dicking around with it for like two days, couldn't figure out how to customize the layout. I know nothing of PERL and really don't want to know. The reason I can't figure it out is mainly because the settings are all spread out over about 20 files, whereas with blogger, they're all in one spot. not to say blogger isn't a pain in the ass, and eventually I'm going to make my own template, but for the moment, it's blogger, and it'll look like this.
