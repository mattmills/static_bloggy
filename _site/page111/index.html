Alex is doing really well, considering the extent of his injury; broken pelvis and a cracked rib to boot would lay anybody up for a few days. Kit on the other hand, is just phenomenal. First of all, she seems about ten times hotter than when I last saw her, is taking care of Alex's every need, setting up a place for him to live and a way to get there and dealing with all the details of wrapping up his Santa Fe life. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0002.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0002.jpg" ></a><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0003.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0003.jpg" ></a><br />I'm doing little things, like driving, and craigs-listing the truck, but mostly I think I'm here to help everyone keep their shit together and lose it under the stress. I don't know how many times I've told Kit to breathe and "It'll be ok, we'll get it sorted," etc. And then there are the secret missions that i can't really talk about because they're secret and Alex reads this sometimes. You'll enjoy it Al, I swear. <br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0004.jpg"><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0004.jpg" ></a><br />That's about it here so far.

	  So I'm headed home today, and I get a call from Kit, and Alex is in the hospital. Broken pelvis. So I'm going to Santa Fe. Tomorrow I'll go out and see what I can do to help them, Alex and Kit, because they're some of my closest friends and really I'd be a terrible person if I didn't go do what I can. <br /><br />So for all of you OKC people, that's where I'll be for the next couple days/possibly a week or two. Catch you all when I get back. there might/should be updates here as things go; I'll have plenty of time for blogging.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/08/11/js-in-blogger.html">js in blogger</a></h2>
	  so anyway, if you want to do any javascript in blogger, you've gotta put in in your template, in the header, to make it work. as far as I can figure. could be I needed ADATA tags, but anyway, there's source now to embed a javascript gallery into blogger in the post below and the header of the blog. This is for people that have their own server space. All the functions are in the header, and the stuff in the post is function calls and definitions, how many photos and where to get them. File names go in the array, and if you name your photos 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg, etc, then you won't have to even change that.<br /><br />I had an awesome weekend though. Crazy coincidences, party, artshow/b-boys. 950 pictures saturday night/sunday morning. I danced! I talked to pretty girls, ran towards a fight, slept on a couch, and had brunch in style on sunday. shitty javascript too, fixed monday in 15 minutes of fresh coding on lunch. also some shitty food sometime before sunday evening made me miss soccer, not the brunch though, that was too soon. <br /><br />Some of the photos below are real keepers, as in they're going in my portfolio. Into the edit I'm doing now at least. I decided that I need the <a href="http://www.adorama.com/INKD700.html">D700</a> beacuse let's face it, I would have a lot less blurries at ISO 25000. and the focusing screen! so much better. It won't make me a better photographer, but it's one hell of a lot sharper knife to cut with, if you can dig it. <br /><br />Video of the sequence of b-boys coming whenever I get my shit together, maybe tomorrow. If it were my job I would have done it sunday. But my job is boring, dull, and unimaginative. Fuck it, I'm going to go do that now. Video before I sleep if it kills me tomorrow.
