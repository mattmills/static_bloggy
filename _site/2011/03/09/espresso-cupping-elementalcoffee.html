  <h2>espresso cupping @elementalcoffee</h2>
  <p>just a couple photos&#8230; got a bunch more in the queue. It&#8217;s amazing how far behind you get when you start a month behind and then lose the use of your laptop for a week and a half. But enough excuses. I&#8217;m working on a bunch of things&#8230; couple photo shoots coming up hopefully, coding some interesting side projects. I have to wonder: is the extra mental energy spent on coding a drain on my photography? I think it is. If nothing else, there&#8217;s only so much time in a day. I don&#8217;t sleep much. Oh well. That&#8217;s what the coffee obsession is for.</p>
<p>Speaking of, this was a really enlightening day. It was down at Elemental&#8217;s new Alley Bar, which is, as I&#8217;ve written before, pretty amazing. I learned a lot about espresso blending and what exactly goes into it. A lot of coffee was drank. One blend had the distinct flavor of peanut shells, I&#8217;ll never forget it. But the real blend, what we came out with, was amazing. Lots of complexity and goodness. I wish more coffee shops in town used Elemental. Actually, scratch that: I wish less shops in town used Neighbors. I wish some of them would actually taste good coffee and think about what they&#8217;re serving. &lt;/rant&gt; Anyway, this was a pleasure. They&#8217;re open limited hours in the mornings right now, but totally worth getting up a little early to get to.</p>
