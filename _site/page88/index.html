	  <span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Last night was... interesting. I made a little trip to norman, basically to fix a light for some friends. They couldn't get the globe back on. It was actually on of those "any excuse to get out of the house is a good one" trips. Heading down there, the traffic was epic, and then my exit was closed, so I got lost, and it ended up taking me 45 minutes for a 20 minute trip. typical. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />For all that effort though, I was rewarded. Tracy (my friend with the broken light, remember?) made two pizzas. There would be pictures of them, but I was busy eating it. Delicious. Then I got introduced to "it's always sunny in philadelphia" which is a combination of awesome and strange and disturbing. the night then proceeded to get better. I took this photo on the way out:<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then I went to the blue note, where there was much pool playing and a little drinking. Ran into Tommy G and Josh, and it was actually mostly dry, so we went riding. Couple parking garages scaled, a ride to best buy where we discovered that their trash was sealed. Exhaustion. Home. bed. That's about it.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Tommy g with the evil look of the day.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >me, taken by dude who's name I can't remember.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >No name dude, by me. If you're reading this, sorry dude. I forget names really easily.</span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
