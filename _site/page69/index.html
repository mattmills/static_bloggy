	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/09/norman-playground.html">Norman Playground</a></h2>
	  So to put a capper on an unbelievably amazing day, we went down to norman, where Amber and her fiancee Josh fed us cake and roast and squash. Even the squash was good, and I've never like it in the past. Might have to revise that sentiment now. Anyway, we watched a movie, something weird with Zooey Deschanel and some dude adopting a baby from china.Weird ending, but I think I liked it. Then we all went to the park, where it was very dark. Too dark to focus using normal methods; zen methods were employed with some success. As sharp as can be, considering 1/10th of a second at f/1.2 and ISO 25000. You don't believe me, you go out and try it. Anyway, pictures:<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0022.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Chelsea took this one, she said I needed pics of myself on my birthday.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/09/25th-birthday-photoshoot-awesomeness.html">25th Birthday, photoshoot, awesomeness</a></h2>
	  Basically last sunday was one of the best days I've ever had, right up there with my 20th birthday, the day I graduated high school, and the field day at summer arts' institute. Might even be the best, what with all the excellent madness and amazing people and things. <br /><br />I woke up and went home, had a good breakfast with the family, eggs, home fries, bacon, the kind of meal you dream of later. Then I coordinated with Chelsea and Meaghan for the shoot later that day (don't cheat, there's tons of story before we get to those pictures). We were going to go to Stillwater and make a big production, but Maeghan had cut her foot badly the night before. She didn't want to cancel, so I suggested we scale back, just do one of the ideas and do it here in the city. So we did, and chelsea came down and met us at Sauced. Cyrus showed up on his motorbike (dubbed the aluminum falcon because it's also a piece of crap) and said hello and whatnot, and then jetted, and so did we. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />We found a place to do the painting, over at Grant (<a href="http://twitter.com/schofield">@schofield</a>) and Damaris' (<a href="http://twitter.com/somna">@somna</a>) house, but they weren't going to be home, so we went in search of coffee, and failed. What we did find, Sara Sara, was downright creepy. But their cupcakes were decent and the milk bar was brilliant. They need to work on their coffee offerings though. Real espresso would be nice.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then I waited, while Maeghan did the work and Chelsea sat very still. This is what the waiting was like: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Now add to that 20 mosquito bites, and I decided to go inside to wait. This is what the girls were up to:<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And later: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And finally, on location, swatting a bee: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And the final silhouette: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0021.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There's another picture up at <a href="http://thenakedsun.com">The Naked Sun</a> our literary journal. That's right, I said "our"- I'm one of the editors and web designer, and if everybody is half as cool as then seem, and can manage to meet deadlines, we're going to be the raddest thing out there. <br /><br />From the shoot, we dropped Maeghan off to go get her foot checked out, and headed to Norman for cake and more adventures. Tune in in a coupla hours, and there'll be more pics.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/03/sherree-chamberlain.html">Sherree Chamberlain</a></h2>
	  This is the band and the singer/songwriter that the crew that I was there to photograph was there to film. Wait, let me rephrase. I showed up and my friend Tomee was there with a film crew to record Sherree and her band, and Tomee asked me if I would shoot some production stills, so I did. And I got backstage access for the whole show, and some nice pictures; My friend and fellow photographer <a href="http://jeremycharles.com">Jeremy Charles</a> said something on twitter about the joy of the performer being why he does concert photography, and I saw what he meant shooting these pictures. I shouldn't be surprised that he also has a <a href="http://www.jeremycharles.com/blog/index.php/2009/05/27/sherree-chamberlain-photos/">gallery</a> of photos of Chamberlain too. Dude knows what's up. Girl can sing and entertain and has the look too. <br /> <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
