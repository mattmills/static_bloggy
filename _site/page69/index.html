	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/09/25th-birthday-photoshoot-awesomeness.html">25th Birthday, photoshoot, awesomeness</a></h2>
	  Basically last sunday was one of the best days I've ever had, right up there with my 20th birthday, the day I graduated high school, and the field day at summer arts' institute. Might even be the best, what with all the excellent madness and amazing people and things. <br /><br />I woke up and went home, had a good breakfast with the family, eggs, home fries, bacon, the kind of meal you dream of later. Then I coordinated with Chelsea and Meaghan for the shoot later that day (don't cheat, there's tons of story before we get to those pictures). We were going to go to Stillwater and make a big production, but Maeghan had cut her foot badly the night before. She didn't want to cancel, so I suggested we scale back, just do one of the ideas and do it here in the city. So we did, and chelsea came down and met us at Sauced. Cyrus showed up on his motorbike (dubbed the aluminum falcon because it's also a piece of crap) and said hello and whatnot, and then jetted, and so did we. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />We found a place to do the painting, over at Grant (<a href="http://twitter.com/schofield">@schofield</a>) and Damaris' (<a href="http://twitter.com/somna">@somna</a>) house, but they weren't going to be home, so we went in search of coffee, and failed. What we did find, Sara Sara, was downright creepy. But their cupcakes were decent and the milk bar was brilliant. They need to work on their coffee offerings though. Real espresso would be nice.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then I waited, while Maeghan did the work and Chelsea sat very still. This is what the waiting was like: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Now add to that 20 mosquito bites, and I decided to go inside to wait. This is what the girls were up to:<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And later: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And finally, on location, swatting a bee: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And the final silhouette: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0021.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There's another picture up at <a href="http://thenakedsun.com">The Naked Sun</a> our literary journal. That's right, I said "our"- I'm one of the editors and web designer, and if everybody is half as cool as then seem, and can manage to meet deadlines, we're going to be the raddest thing out there. <br /><br />From the shoot, we dropped Maeghan off to go get her foot checked out, and headed to Norman for cake and more adventures. Tune in in a coupla hours, and there'll be more pics.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/03/sherree-chamberlain.html">Sherree Chamberlain</a></h2>
	  This is the band and the singer/songwriter that the crew that I was there to photograph was there to film. Wait, let me rephrase. I showed up and my friend Tomee was there with a film crew to record Sherree and her band, and Tomee asked me if I would shoot some production stills, so I did. And I got backstage access for the whole show, and some nice pictures; My friend and fellow photographer <a href="http://jeremycharles.com">Jeremy Charles</a> said something on twitter about the joy of the performer being why he does concert photography, and I saw what he meant shooting these pictures. I shouldn't be surprised that he also has a <a href="http://www.jeremycharles.com/blog/index.php/2009/05/27/sherree-chamberlain-photos/">gallery</a> of photos of Chamberlain too. Dude knows what's up. Girl can sing and entertain and has the look too. <br /> <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/03/location-location.html">Location, Location</a></h2>
	  Sunday was location scouting. And thrift stores. And a nondisclosure agreement, so I'm not sure what I can and can't say, but none of these are embargoed, formally or informally, so there you have it. We're working on cool shit, and when it comes out it's going to be really rad, but that's not for four months or so, so expect teasers and hints and nothing substantive until at least january.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Credit where credit is due: photo by Chelsea M'lynn.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/03/another-monday.html">Another Monday</a></h2>
	  Monday rolls around and I'm looking for polaroid film when who should call me but <a href="http://www.furburger.org">Christa May</a>, wondering if I'm down for a little libation at Mcnellie's. Of course I am. I'm always down for Mcnellie's.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Logan and Matt, not me, but Christa's new dude. Isn't it nice how everyone seems to be forming couples at the same time? Or at least several of my friends have over the past few weeks.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Matt by himself. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I'm posting all three of these because I can't remember which she liked and I think they all look pretty decent. #3 is the best, but who am I to judge? Oh yeah, that's my job. So yeah, just ignore the first two, those are just for Christa. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
