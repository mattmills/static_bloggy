	  <h2><a href="/2009/08/11/booze-cruise-meets-broquest.html">Booze Cruise Meets BROQUEST</a></h2>
	  Or at least one of the members of BROQUEST was there. All in all, a fun night. I keep hearing that other people are doing booze cruise on saturdays now, if that's true could someone tell me? Chris? I just want to drink and ride bikes with people, and who cares what night it's on, right? <br /><br />Anyway, between last week's illness, starting the new job, and all the things I was doing over the weekend, I've been neglecting all the backend stuff- editing, organizing, and blogging. It's tiring, and the list of things I need to get done tomorrow is a mile and a half long. May or may not do all/some of it. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  I felt kinda really off shooting saturday, ended up dancing as much as photographing.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/08/05/technical-difficulties.html">Technical difficulties...</a></h2>
	  For those of you paying attention, there has been a little hiatus, a delay, a mini vacation even... Partly because of work, and the interruption to my sleep schedule, but also partly because it seems like I pick up every little bug that comes along since my accident. I felt like death for 48 hours, and I still have something of a sore throat, but I think I'm going to be all right. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />These pics are from Monday; Lori texted me from work, asking me to get people up there, so I did; <a href="http://www.furburger.org">Christa</a> and Jonathan came out and had drinks. It's sort of a hellish job, working in a karaoke bar; I hope Lori gets something else soon. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, I like my new job so far. It's actually challenging to steam milk. I still don't really have a grasp of what I'm really doing, but that will come in time. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And for those of you that have read this far down, a surprise: Booze cruise is happening this Friday, 9pm. The plan is to do two rounds at each bar, so we can keep some kind of momentum. Starting at the rooster, have a couple pitchers, then to the drunken fry, because I really want to try that truffle shit, and then to nancy's, so we can all get banned from yet another karaoke bar. I'm going to be annoying everyone in my phone/twitter followers about this too for the next couple days, hopefully enough people come out. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/08/02/iso-25000.html">ISO 25,000</a></h2>
	  So this is crazy, really wild, I mean, talk about no light, some of these are taken in the reflected mirror ball light off a black wall, just insanely no light at all, but here are the pictures. This is going to be fun. I'm playing around at ISO 25k, which is just unheard of, it's so noisy it's an extra level of abstraction. Focus is "guess and get lucky sometimes," other times it's just blurry and that doesn't really hurt things because these pictures aren't about detail but about energy and tone and exploring places that heretofore were invisible to the camera, and a lot of times to the eye. These are places people go but not places that are easily seen unless you go there, at least until now. Enough ramble. The photos!<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
