	  <p>well, not my neighborhodd, but the one I was staying in&#8230; I conceived a big typology type project while I was there. All the cemeteries of New Orleans. Of course, I&#8217;d have to live there&#8230; if the city doesn&#8217;t sink before I get the chance to move there, that is. It&#8217;d be a couple years. When I&#8217;m looking to semi-retire or something. or when I get a wild hair and have to light out. Although, as my local friends advised me, it&#8217;d be easier if I picked a subset to look at. I could spend a long time looking at these angels, for example.</p>

	  <p>So we drove down to Cocodrie, which is the middle of nowhere, reaching out towards the gulf of mexico. Even the middle of nowhere has trash pickup these days. That&#8217;s america for ya. The birds were nice, flying to roost somewhere at sunset, and the sunset was pretty awesome, too. Nice to get away from it all for a minute. Which was the point of the trip, come to think of it.</p>

	  <p>between things, so a quick blog post&#8230; charging my phone, actually. Toured the Abita brewery while I was in Louisiana&#8230; that&#8217;s the crowd in the first photo. That&#8217;s Lane(y?) and Jeana sorta dancing at rock n&#8217; bowl in the second&#8230; and finishing off the night at some local bar in the third. I like that bars there don&#8217;t close except when the bartender feels like it. It lets the night flow much more naturally. Speaking of bars, my phone is charged enough to get me through the night and I&#8217;m off.</p>

	  <p>So this was a long stop motion video that I think they were going to set to music and have a video; and at then end they knocked it all down. This rings all sorts of bells for me as a critic and artist; it&#8217;s collaborative, impermanent, made for reproduction&#8230; things I like, more or less. But standing there, looking at it, most of it sucked; right as it was about to go somewhere interesting one or more of the parties involved would fuck it up. Come to think of it though, that&#8217;ll probably look pretty good on video.</p>
