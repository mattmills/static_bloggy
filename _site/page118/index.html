	  I like beer. I like women, I like sunlight on my face. I like the cold of the morning, the warmth of laying next to someone. I like wandering, meeting new people, the light of streetlights, the light when there isn't any. <br /><br />I like my bicycle, the wind in my face. I like sweating and feeling tired and the deep ache of exhaustion. I like sleep, I like to dream. I like taking pictures. I like my job, because I like money. <br /><br />I like the feeling of moving. I like getting on a plane. I like just driving for the sake of moving, without a destination. I like the music of the road, both from the stereo and the tires. <br /><br />I like the curve of your hips, your deep brown eyes, your quick smile, the way I can read you so easily. I like the way you smell, even in the morning. I like your tattoos.  I miss you, Jess.<br /><br />That's all, except to say that you could easily put love instead of like.

	  Went back to Paseo arts fest yesterday, met up with some more new cool kids, lots of fixed gear riders. Glad to see some community here around cycles. A lot of the kids seem genuinely cool. <br /><br />PS- sorry the post yesterday was so incoherent. spillover from the crazy week. Photos!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0525-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0525-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0525-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0525-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

	  because there's dudes out there keepin it real, reality being important as it's all we have. That's not true, we have imagination too, angels have wings because they take themselves lightly, so we must do the same if we hope to fly. I'm rambling drunk if you can't tell.<br /><br />Just took a nice ride over to Sauced, the bike and dog friendly hippyish pizza place just north of 23rd. Good pizza, ran into some kids, one who I think I knew from somewhere, but unfortunately he was an asshole and wouldn't talk to me. He happened to have photos, but they were terribly cliche, super white girl in black underwear with a gas mask, black and white, you know, art school special. but then this other dude turned out to be cool, rides fixed gear, works in a shop here, knows the scene pretty well. appearently there are a couple bike gangs. Who knew? Alleycat next week too. So that'll be fun. <br /><br />Let's see. Had some work stuff which I'm not going to talk about, because unfortunately, my job has some confidentiality required. But it was handled quickly and efficiently once I went over to my bosses house, the man has connections, and I'll leave it at that. Lucky for all of us, and I have a feeling it would have been me taking shit for it if he hadn't worked it out. Then again, he got to know all the people he knows by being a really nice guy, so who knows?<br /><br />Looking forward to going to the paseo arts fest tomorrow. I'll probably bike over. It's another day in paradise, and I get to sleep in. Peace.
