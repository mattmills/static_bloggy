	  <h2><a href="/2008/09/10/nola-and-stuff.html">NOLA and stuff</a></h2>
	  Been a long couple of days. Lot of things happening. Where to begin...<br /><br />New Orleans is an amazing city, the kind of place just on the cusp of some really cool things happening. After disaster comes innovation and change, and it's such a wild place it's bound to come there. It might not have the population to count, but it's such a great combination of cool people and danger and culture and history that things are bound to happen.<br /><br />It was also great to see Jeana and Hope, the real reason I was down there. They act a lot like a married couple, in a funny co-dependent way. Good people, and I'm not just saying that because they read this. Hi Ladies. <br /><br />Also, I drove by the lower 9th ward. It's a whole neighborhood, but subtract all the people and leave the houses to rot for 3 years, and that's what's left. It's shameful and angering, and we should do better. <br /><br />A lot of time in airports. I'm weird in that I really like the airport, even with the bullshit you have to go through to get to the gate. The one thing I don't like is the cramped seats on some of the smaller planes. But airports are such weird inbetween borderlike places that I can't help but love them. <br /><br />And then two days of work. Somehow we ended up talking about politics a lot today, and I have to say it was refreshing. When you talk to people, you actually have to think about why you have your ideas of how things should be and back them up. That and it also sharpens your wits, if you keep thinking after you're done talking, about why and the flaws in what the other person said and how to explain your POV better the next time. <br /><br />Anyway, pictures to follow.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/09/05/in-the-airport.html">In the Airport</a></h2>
	  so, I'm chillin in the airport, and waiting on a flight. By the way, fuck all the politicians. I'm on my way to the city that care forgot, otherwise known as New Orleans. I don't know what to expect. That's the best reason I know to go anywhere: it's impossible to get an idea of some places with out going there. The truth of the situation can only be grasped from ground level. Too many stories over too much time, too much mental clutter. I hate to say it but average reporting is a pale gray thing next to the vital lived experience of a place.we'll see. More as it happens.

	  So I finally downloaded the card that's been in my camera for two weeks. Andrew, and if you look closely, you can see yr. humble photographer:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0001.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0001.jpg"  /></a><br />Sunset, at more or less the same time:<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0002.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0002.jpg"  /></a><br />Anne and Kit, in the mountains. These two together (or separately) are just really awesome, good company and good friends.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0003.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0003.jpg"  /></a><br /><br />Clines Corners tourist trap, where I had an early lunch.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0004.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0004.jpg"  /></a><br />And I'm still doggedly taking my camera to the supermarket. Yes, there are still more pictures to be had there.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0005.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0005.jpg"  /></a><br />And this is my current project: updating my portfolio. Hopefully by the end of the week I'll have shopped it around and have real work as a photojournalist.<br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0006.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0006.jpg"  /></a>
