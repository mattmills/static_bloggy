	  <h2><a href="/2008/04/10/ok-so-people-are-coming-here-again-yay.html">ok, so people are coming here again, YAY!</a></h2>
	  And by again, I mean for the first time. Hi everyone, even you people who were looking for "Matt Mills porn" in google. No porn here, just good clean photography. While I might occaisionally take pictures of scantily clad women, naked ones even (although that hasn't happened in a while; other things to do when I get naked with a girl, you know), there's no porn here, and don't hold your breath. Seriously, it's a little weird that someone is searching my name with porn. Could be worse. They could be searching "Matt Mills assassination."<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />It's been a good couple of days. <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.html">Tony</a> keeps on rocking out, although some easy to find permalinks would be nice. The top and third posts as of this writing, about needing to write every day, are awesome, the reason I keep going back to his blog, even when he's dragging, even when some weeks he only posts about shit I don't want to hear. Because in 7 years reading his blog, he's been consistently pulling out awesome writing like that, sooner or later. And all the hotchicks, I'm not gonna lie.<br /><br />So, the good news is that I'm doing all right. Several good things have happened to me in the last 24 hours. I had a primo steak for dinner, fresh french fries, all delicious. I then went and had coffee with Lora and Sabrina, two friends of mine, both of whom I owe pictures, sorry girls, I swear I'm on it right after I write this. Lora had to go home and sleep, she works, and I can't decide if I'm jealous of her having a job, you know, with income, or if I'm glad I'm not tied down like that, needing to be in bed by a certain time. Although that never stopped me from staying up before.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />So, that left me and Sabrina to run around town a bunch. Sabrina's an old friend, from high school, but I haven't seen her since last fall, so we had a bit of catching up to do. We talked for a while, drove around some, and got out and walked some too. The photos are from the walking and the driving. Yes, I take photos even when I'm driving sometimes. I do it really fast, and I never leave my lane, although sometimes a little swerving is involved. So yeah, we walked and talked, and before you know it it was 11:30 and Sabrina's husband was calling and asking where his wife was, and so we ambled back to the car and I took her home.<br /><br />Then I went home and read for a while. <a href="http://www.johndiesattheend.com/">John Dies at the End</a>  is a really cool story. A little disconnected at times, but worth reading. Really scary at points, too, something that few stories do for me. To answer the riddle at the beginning: No. By the way, the title is deceptive. That's all I'm saying.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />OK, so with that out of the way, I gotta go do up the photos. Peace everyone/MAtt

	  I was going to blog about my night, but then I decided not to. Let's say there was pool and drinking and staying out very late indeed, good times had by all, and leave it at that. oh yeah, and I lose a thousand words to a stupid mistake.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/04/07/the-things-i-carry.html">The things I carry...</a></h2>
	  So, because I have nothing to blog about right now, I thought I'd blog about what I think of as my adventure kit (edit: Yes, it's a purse, no, that doesn't bother me. A;though the wallet and keys and such are in my pockets, not in the bag). It's a bag I carry almost everywhere, and has all of my essentials.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I always have my camera, an EOS 5D, and the 50mm 1.2 lens mounted, excellent for us nocturnal beasts. Also pictured is the utilitarian 24-105, which keeps me from having to carry five fixed lenses, god bless it. In the column of camera stuff, there's also the waterproof card wallet and the extra battery.<br /><br />There's also the mundane stuff: A metal wallet, cell phone, swiss army knife, pens, notebook, tiny flashlight, business cards (the black thing on the wallet is my business card holder). A tin of altoids for breath.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least is the Nokia N800, which is a gadget, I'll admit, but I stay on top of email with it, and it's a lot lighter than a laptop. It does everything a bigger computer does, only smaller. Now if someone would just help me figure out how to easily get the RAW files from my camera out to small jpegs for blogging, I'd hardly need a laptop at all.<br /><br />And what do I carry it all in? I'm glad you asked. This is the Emsquared Super Adventure Plus 2.0 camera bag, with kevlar strap, in handsome gray fabric.  The ESAP features a main compartment of 9x4.5x6.5, with three subdivider pockets for organization. Seriously, I knocked this together last night.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I like it, but it needs some breaking in. Which I'm going to go do now.

	  I just rode 25 miles, thither and yon and back again, here in oak shitty (that's oklahoma city, for those not in the know). I feel a lot better. So, thanks, Alex, for introducing to me how awesome they are.<br /><br />One thing about this town: the wind is fucking killer. As in, it will kill you sometimes, whether you're watching or not. I was almost knocked over a couple of times by gusts. I have to wonder if anyone here does a wind blog, with all sorts of wind related ephemera?  Wind jokes,  stats, photos,  videos... hmm.<br /><br />Anyway, about halfway through my ride, I was crossing the highway on an overpass, and I saw these signs. The wind knocked them over, I swear.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Just the road...<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Self-portrait in black and white.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/04/06/delete-me.html">delete me</a></h2>
	  Like something out of a sci-fi novel, I came home and found myself already in my bed. What the hell?<br /><br />"Hey, what are you doing here?"<br /><br />Other me sat up in bed. "I'm here from the future. I need to tell you something very important."<br /><br />"What? ok, you're from the future. What kind of day will I have tommorow, so I know you're on the level?"<br /><br />"You'll wake up, go pick up lora for sodas, go have the meeting with only three editors, and then... well, that's what i'm here to-"<br /><br />And then he dissappeared. Yeah, this didn't really happen. I just didn't feel like putting up pictures right now, feeling lazy. have fun without me, internet.
