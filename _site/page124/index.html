	  I was going to blog about my night, but then I decided not to. Let's say there was pool and drinking and staying out very late indeed, good times had by all, and leave it at that. oh yeah, and I lose a thousand words to a stupid mistake.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/04/07/the-things-i-carry.html">The things I carry...</a></h2>
	  So, because I have nothing to blog about right now, I thought I'd blog about what I think of as my adventure kit (edit: Yes, it's a purse, no, that doesn't bother me. A;though the wallet and keys and such are in my pockets, not in the bag). It's a bag I carry almost everywhere, and has all of my essentials.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I always have my camera, an EOS 5D, and the 50mm 1.2 lens mounted, excellent for us nocturnal beasts. Also pictured is the utilitarian 24-105, which keeps me from having to carry five fixed lenses, god bless it. In the column of camera stuff, there's also the waterproof card wallet and the extra battery.<br /><br />There's also the mundane stuff: A metal wallet, cell phone, swiss army knife, pens, notebook, tiny flashlight, business cards (the black thing on the wallet is my business card holder). A tin of altoids for breath.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least is the Nokia N800, which is a gadget, I'll admit, but I stay on top of email with it, and it's a lot lighter than a laptop. It does everything a bigger computer does, only smaller. Now if someone would just help me figure out how to easily get the RAW files from my camera out to small jpegs for blogging, I'd hardly need a laptop at all.<br /><br />And what do I carry it all in? I'm glad you asked. This is the Emsquared Super Adventure Plus 2.0 camera bag, with kevlar strap, in handsome gray fabric.  The ESAP features a main compartment of 9x4.5x6.5, with three subdivider pockets for organization. Seriously, I knocked this together last night.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I like it, but it needs some breaking in. Which I'm going to go do now.

	  I just rode 25 miles, thither and yon and back again, here in oak shitty (that's oklahoma city, for those not in the know). I feel a lot better. So, thanks, Alex, for introducing to me how awesome they are.<br /><br />One thing about this town: the wind is fucking killer. As in, it will kill you sometimes, whether you're watching or not. I was almost knocked over a couple of times by gusts. I have to wonder if anyone here does a wind blog, with all sorts of wind related ephemera?  Wind jokes,  stats, photos,  videos... hmm.<br /><br />Anyway, about halfway through my ride, I was crossing the highway on an overpass, and I saw these signs. The wind knocked them over, I swear.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Just the road...<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Self-portrait in black and white.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/04/06/delete-me.html">delete me</a></h2>
	  Like something out of a sci-fi novel, I came home and found myself already in my bed. What the hell?<br /><br />"Hey, what are you doing here?"<br /><br />Other me sat up in bed. "I'm here from the future. I need to tell you something very important."<br /><br />"What? ok, you're from the future. What kind of day will I have tommorow, so I know you're on the level?"<br /><br />"You'll wake up, go pick up lora for sodas, go have the meeting with only three editors, and then... well, that's what i'm here to-"<br /><br />And then he dissappeared. Yeah, this didn't really happen. I just didn't feel like putting up pictures right now, feeling lazy. have fun without me, internet.

	  Yep, the last week has been a doozy. Let's see... I started out with a hangover and cold. I decided to build a camera, and to get everyone else in the world to help me. www.opensourcecamera.org. I also finally got around to starting that magazine, called Gestalt, www.gestaltnews.com. I took some photos, wandered around a bit. Talked to Lora some, maybe straightened out some things with her. Haven't talked to Jess, though, hopefully she'll get back to me soon. I had a nice day driving around today, anyway. I'm gonna let the pictures tell the rest.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-1.jpg"><img style="" 0px="" auto="" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Elaine's new installation...<br><br><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>At the bar<br><br><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>I don't think he likes me.
