	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/08/some-random-photos.html">Some random photos:</a></h2>
	  There's a post about momentum coming, but to tide everyone over until I can get that together, here's some photos from earlier in the week. Francois, on wednesday: <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Ray-guns, at McNellie's:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Cody at blue note:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />It was one of those nights where I was the drunk one. Not as drunk as some people, though, and that turned out to be a good thing. I told Sarah early on in the night that I'd make sure she got home alright. She did, and I crashed on her couch.  My good deed for the week done, I give you the morning after:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />More in a few minutes, when I get the real momentum post together.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/08/momentum-artshow.html">Momentum Artshow</a></h2>
	  Momentum 09 was last night, and I was really surprised by the quality and scope and size and attendance of the show. It was packed, the work was 75% good, all stuff I'm not used to seeing in this town, and it filled a freaking warehouse. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There were a lot of big open installations, a lof of big cool paintings, some shit photos (sorry everyone, but the photo showing this year just wasn't that great, with a few notable exceptions). Hving these clouds right by the entrance set the mood for the place: it was as if someone took a piece of a real art scene out of the air of New York or Santa Fe and stuck it here in oak city, improbably and strangely. So it seemed natural to see a crib full of beer bongs and a whole room of homoerotic black fraternity induction paintings. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then there was my friend Bobby's band, playing a pretty rad live set. If they'd had a cd available, I'd have bought one, and that's not something I do a lot. These kids know how to rock. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then there was this womblike installation in what used to be a woman's restroom. It was completely transformed and amazing; all it needed was some giant pillows on the floor and some mild hallucinogenic gas in the air and it would have been perfect.    <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I didn't know what to think of the deer. But I like the photo, so sue me. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Some MC, not all that great. Nobody's perfect, maybe he was havin' an off night. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Then there was the after after after party, which was really about four people in Jim's apartment eating cheese and drinking french wine. I'd like to say it was a nice end to the night, but there were a couple fights on the lawn that complicated things. So instead it was kind of a haggard exhausted end to the evening, but at least it was in good company.  <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/02/candid-portraits-for-hire.html">Candid Portraits for Hire</a></h2>
	  <img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />So, this is a New Idea. At least, I think it's new, and if it isn't, well, I don't know anybody that does it. The idea is, a lot of people like to have good pictures of their family; in fact, this is the only thing a lot of people care to have pictures of. But studio pictures from places like walmart or sears or even glamour shots suck.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />So instead of a studio, what about the home? And instead of a quick grin-and-grab, what about spending some time with the family, say two hours- over dinner, maybe, or an afternoon in the park? Candid pictures the whole time, and give the family digital copies that they can do whatever they want with? If they want to order prints through me, that's fine, but I'd rather make money shooting than printing, so that's where the charges come from.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />The pictures here in this post were shot in the space of about an hour and a half; These aren't all of the keepers, just enough for a teaser. I ended up sending the family 25 images in all, all of which I was happy with.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />So, if anyone is interested in this being done with their family, just drop me a line at my email, rates are negotiable, and depend on how much and what you want me to do.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/02/28/perspectives-more-like-photos.html">Perspectives? More like Photos</a></h2>
	  Last night was portrait night, or a really wild ass night, or a depressing fucker, or a wild debauch, all depending on your perspective. Crying girls, a night in the drunk tank, someone got neck punched, someone else got shot down, couple people got laid (I assume), someone went 59mph on rollers, it goes on and on. Me, I took it mellow, took some pictures, and passed out on a couch. I'm feeling lazy, so here's photos. If you want more details, call someone who knows. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0001.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0002.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0003.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0005.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0006.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0007.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0008.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0009.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0010.jpg" alt="Photos"/><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0011.jpg" alt="Photos"/>
