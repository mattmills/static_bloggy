	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/01/code-for-a-cause-comes-to-coco.html">Code for a Cause comes to CoCo</a></h2>
	  So saturday was a busy day, spent mostly recovering from friday in the morning, but I did manage to stop by the <a href="www.okccoco.com">CoCo</a> for a minute to snap a few pictures of code for a cause, a really neat charity that provieds web site makeovers for nonprofits. 600 hours of web design and coding all compressed into one day. Pretty awesome. Wish I could have stayed longer. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/08/27/big-truck-tacos.html">Big Truck Tacos</a></h2>
	  So, back when I was trying to start a city blog for okc, and at the same time still blogging here and doing my best imitation of a fish's drinking habits, I had a series that would have been titled "I love it here"- reviews of good shit here in OKC that would have been a regular feature if the blog had had more than three readers. Shows you how good I am at promotion. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >The inside of the place is nicely decorated, with good seating.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bigtruck/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I had a couple steak al carbon tacos, a mexican coke, and chips and salsa. The tacos were good, not too greasy, with corn tortillas and onions for flavor. About that flavor: I wish I could say it was on par with other places I've had tacos locally, (I'm looking at you, Iguana, with all your deliciousness) but there just wasn't enough. All I got was beef and onion, no spice. That said, they were good, and with the salsa, not bad at all. The chips and salsa were chips and salsa, good and fresh. A word on Mexican Coke: you should try it. They use real cane sugar to make it, which has a better flavor than high fructose bullshit. Really better than what you get out of the fountain. I think I paid 9 bucks for the meal, and I was pretty satisfied when I was done. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Any place with patio seating is a win in this town. We Okies like to dine al fresco.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bigtruck/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, Big Truck Tacos would have been a natural fit for that series. They're a locally owned newish place, right in the middle of the part of 23rd street that I was betting would see development 6 months ago... and here we are, already a new restaurant. And they're good. Great patio seating, nice atmos inside, fast service, friendly staff, and that awesome location,  they've got all the stuff they need lined up to be a success. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Not a food photographer. But doesn't this look good? Needs more seasoning to be perfect, though.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bigtruck/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Definitely recommended, and you'll probably see me there trying out more menu items as the weeks progress.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/08/26/the-morning-after.html">The Morning After</a></h2>
	  This is the last of the pics from last weekend. Man, that was epic. I'm basically doing two jobs, but only getting paid for one; I'm a lowly barista, and I'm a photographer, shooting all the time and editing when I can, around my social and work schedule. It's actually pretty fun, I just don't sleep a lot these days. Never did sleep much though. <br /><br />That morning, though, I woke up and felt fine; six whole hours of sleep does wonders, even when there's half a bottle of rum involved. then we did brunch at Cafe do Brasil. They really have the best sunday brunch, and my favorite chorizo in town. Then onto sauced to hang out on the patio and soak up the sun on a gorgeous day. A fantastic end to a really great weekend. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Chelsea stretching. I love the lines in this one; odd parallels you don't expect take a second to resolve. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0038.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Again with Chelsea. Did I mention she's also gorgeous? Yeah. Now I have.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0039.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Pearl looking all stoic and really not hungover.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0040.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This puppy was cute as hell.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/08/26/myl-chelseas-after-party-photos.html">MYL Chelsea's After Party Photos</a></h2>
	  I first met <a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0033.jpg">Chelsea</a> at the bike prom on friday- she seemed interesting in a "you're a person with interesting ideas" kind of way, then she showed up here in the city for Made You Look and the afterparty, and turns out we're into a lot of the same things, photography and journalism and documentary work, and we're getting along famously at the party when she asks to see my camera, and I hand it over (this is after several stout rum and cokes, mind), and she runs off taking pictures like there's no tomorrow. And I don't know, something about the way I can see she's concentrating, I let her keep going with it for a while. <br /><br />I'm really glad I did because she's really good. Focus is on the money, compositionally interesting, good moments, the whole bit. I asked her later, after seeing the pictures, if she had any experience. "I just shoot everything I love. Always have," she tells me. And that's exactly it folks, what I've been saying for years: shoot what you love, the rest is just technicalities. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0021.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0022.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0023.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0024.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
