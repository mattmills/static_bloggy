	  Friday was fun as shit. Definitely the best night out I've had in a while that didn't involve getting far too drunk. Actually, there was drinking, of course. But the funness was from the dancing and the company, Amber and Kat and some of their friends, oh yeah, and I saw Grizzly Bear's tour bus.  At least, that's what someone said it was. No idea who these bands were, forgot their names already, go to the opolis web site and look i9f you care, but they honestly weren't that great, or I would have written the names down or shot the poster or something. But the night as a whole was a blast. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Ghost Bike:</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This guy sucked.

	  I swear I'm not turning into <a href="http://jeremycharles.com">Jeremy Charles</a>, or worse, Annie Leibowitz, but I do seem to be shooting a lot of musicians lately. This band I didn't really like. The sound was super mellow, smooth jazz like, and it really did nothing for me. There were some good moments, when it seemed like a song would break out and do something interesting, but then it got drowned in the hopeless drone. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  Well, samples from the half hour that I was there. It seemed like a really fun time, and if I hadn't been sleep depping and working and whatnot this weekend, I probably would have really enjoyed doing some classes and just sitting around kibitzing with everyone. I could have gotten some of my bookbinding experiments done maybe. Anyway, photos: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/09/23/romantic-disaster-at-hilo.html">Romantic Disaster at HiLo</a></h2>
	  Romantic disaster is a local band that's doing amazing things. They've got a great sound and a great look, the kind that even comes through when they're all wasted and playing a quick set at an AIDS benefit show at a dive like the HiLo. In fact, it probably added to the rawness and unpredictability of the whole thing. Of course, your humble blogger was drunk off his ass, so maybe I was just responding to the visceral loudness and hotness of their lead singer. But I've heard them play before, when I was sober and so were they, and they're good. Put them on your list of bands to catch, and then someday, you can be like, "I saw them in this tiny ass club in OKC. The bassist used to make my pizza." Oh wait, that's me. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
