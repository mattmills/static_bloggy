Well, maybe I have... there was that time in Brazil... or that time... well, anyway, I seem to just stay exhausted these days. No rest for the wicked.

	  Man, there've been a lot of these events. What is is about people on bikes and donating to charity? Anyway, these rae from the first weekend, when everybody just rode. The second weekend, I didn't really take any photos, I was was processing all of these for your ass. But more people showed then and money and cans were raised, so hopefully some people got fed. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0016.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0017.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0018.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0019.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0020.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0021.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0022.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0023.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0024.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0025.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0026.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  so, I was thinking about twitter... and social media in general... a mistake most so-called experts make is thinking of little updates as <span >broadcasting</span>, when really it's <span >backchannel</span>. You have a hundred twitter followers that also follow you, you're inside that circle of people, messaging them things that are irrelevant or unimportant to the rest of the world, but that they might find useful/entertaining/funny. Non-sequiturs. The useful information that you get from the chatter are the things you wouldn't have found otherwise. Most importantly, it's <span >behind the scenes</span>. <br /><br />That's true for most twitter users, I'd bet. Then there are the "experts" who think of twitter as a place to sell stuff; it's a free way to shout things about your product, after all. The problem is, when seen in the light of the above: all advertising on twitter is effectively noise. If your product is good, it will get word of mouth (actually, you'll get more word of mouth if it's bad or easy to make fun of; see snuggies, slap-chop, etc.).

	  I haven't been posting. I have a shit ton of photos, and they're all uploaded now, so my only excuse is that I'm usually pretty tired of the computer at the end of the day and don't have the energy to write a whole lot or stare at the screen for an extra hour or two to put something together. <br /><br />Anyway, these rae from the beginning photo class I taught at OKCCoCo - I only had four people show up, so it was a little bit of a letdown, but at least I was able to answer some questions and maybe the people learned some things. I said a lot, I know that much.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
