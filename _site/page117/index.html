	  <h2><a href="/2008/06/07/forgetting-names.html">Forgetting names</a></h2>
	  So I'm meeting a bunch of new people, hanging out with more or less the same group for a few weeks, and at times I really feel shitty, because I can't for the life of me remember their names. Actually, it got a lot better tonight (I don't care that the post time says ten something, it's really 3am), there were introductions for someone else new, and I think I'll remember several more now.<br /><br />Adam, who is pictured <a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg">here</a> with his wife, had a really bad wreck. Nobody knows for sure what happened, except some woman saw him come over the side of a bridge over I-44 and stopped to call 911. Multiple injuries, face, knee, ankles, femur, bike's a wreck. I find it hard to believe that all that happened from a fall, but then again, a fall onto concrete from 40 feet (about the height of the bridge) could maybe cause a broken femur. I still think maybe a car was involved. There is maybe a video of the incident, so maybe we can see what happened.<br /><br />It gave me a thought though, about a story I might do. Bike wrecks caused by cars. Close calls. Talk about how scary it is to be out there on the road with a bunch of homicidal maniacs in death machines aimed at you. <br /><br />To tell the truth, I almost didn't ride tonight, I thought about driving. at the last second, i realized it was stupid, that not riding was the worst thing I could do, and so I pedaled up to sauced. And that hand-built wheel I finally put back on the bike? Amazing. Anyway, that's all. I really should offload my card and post pictures, but I'm lazy and tired and I'll do it tomorrow sometime, I swear.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/06/06/work-work-work.html">work, work, work...</a></h2>
	  All week long, so not much to talk about. Although everyone's been asking me wether or not I like my job at work which leads me to believe that someone there has been reading the blog... well, the answer is, I really do like my job. OK? I really like the paycheck, and I know that long term (I'm thinking in years here) it's not what I'm going to end up doing. I get to meet lots of people, push myself in interesting ways. Organization, never my strong suit, is critical, and so I'm learning how to do it. I get to meet interesting people, and one of my strong suits, being endearing to the surly, is a big help some places. <br /><br />My existential doubts the other day (and what I wrote here) were really me thinking out loud. Sometimes I write because I have a good idea, a story to tell. Sometimes I have an idea to work out and if I write it down I can see it better. Then there's what I did the other day: putting my doubts and fears down so I can see if they're real or not after a little time has passed. <br /><br />Now a little time has passed and I've been working and getting a better feel for what is going on, and it's a good thing, for the most part. The problems I have with corporations, big oil, etc. are political problems. This work isn't political in the least. It's just a low level function of a market economy. A demand for information is being filled. <br /><br />Anyway, I need a nap. Photos to follow later, before booze cruise.

	  ...are what the gods gave us to make up for all the shit they put on us. Sometimes, it's enough to make up for it. Sometimes, not so much.<br /><br />Women. What the hell? I thought I'd found someone, and now she's gone off with another guy. (I'm struck now by the recurring themes in my love life, but I digress). How often have I met a woman that I thought was really worthwhile? I'm not talking meet someone who just happens to be smart or sexy and I'm attracted to, but more like love at first sight. You catch a glimpse of her and it's a physical feeling, taking a blow to the head, to the chest, whatever, and you know already that she'll be amazing. <br /><br />It's happened to me three times. I don't know why three, not one or none, I don't know why I'm not still with any of these three wonderful gorgeous smart girls, I don't know a lot of things. My life has been, so far, very much a series of strange and wonderful events that I don't have any hope of understanding.<br /><br />I'll tell the first story, and because she's still around, in the OKC area somewhere, I've gotta come up with an alias. Call her Annie. So, I was in the sixth grade. Walking down a hall at an academic team tourney (jeopardy for schoolkids). we both looked up at the same time, right into each other's eyes, and said "I know you..." Which, of course, we didn't. <br /><br />We talked for a second, and then I didn't see her again until maybe 6 months later. Maybe it was less, maybe it was more.  And I was so inept then that she actually got my phone number first, on some lame excuse. OK, I lied when I used past tense just then. I still suck at details like getting names and numbers. Anyway, we went out for a little less than a year. By then, I was in the eighth grade, and I was talking with my dad, who always has good advice that I don't want to hear, and I could see my whole life stretching out before me. A nice, normal life, go to a state school for free, get a nice job somewhere safe, have my girl with me through the whole thing, yada yada. <br /><br />That's exactly what I thought. How boring. Lame. Go do something fun and exciting with your life. You've gotta burn it up, gotta be more than a cog in a hierarchy of other cogs. Get out of that now, while you can. So, to separate myself from all of that, to cut it off, I did the most destructive thing I could think of: I broke up with the girl I loved. I still don't sleep right.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/06/01/photos-from-most-of-the-weekend.html">Photos from most of the weekend</a></h2>
	  OK, so before I run off and do more crazy shit, the photos and some more story need to go here. So before I was having all those metaphysical doubts, I got home Friday and then turned around and went out to the Rooster to see who would be around and generally  drink. before that though, I ran by best buy and picked up my new ipod, 16gb touch. I actually like it quite a lot, the battery lasts a lot longer than my n800 and the volume goes up louder. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0529-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0529-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Got there to the booze cruise, and it turned out to be mostly booze, which was nice after a fairly long week. Then my bank card came back declined, despite the paycheck I'd put in earlier that day. It was all good, though, between pitchers and people willing to cover me for the cover at the Blue Note. The band they had as sort of all right as long as you didn't pay them any attention, which was hard as loud as they were. By the time we got there the place was more or less empty except for the bar itself. Magically, beers kept appearing in front of me. I was fairly drunk by the end of the night. I rode home probably faster still than any other time, maybe 20 minutes for 8 miles. No stops. It was nice.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Then I woke up Saturday to go to this bike happening in Mesta Park. I stopped on the way to get a new rear tire, the old one was worn through. Saw Mike, who works at the shop and is an all-around nice guy, said hello, had a coffee next door at coffee slingers, which is really good coffee, by the way, and free wifi to boot. <br /><br />On to the park, where there were sprints, a slow race, and all sorts of fun things. That wast most of my day, fixie tricks and hanging out and soaking up the sun. I Helped these two girls with their bikes, little things, seat adjustment and brake tension, but it's little things like that which make a ride fun or a pain in the ass.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a> <br /><br />The next stop was this water park on 36th and Classen, public and free, just out there for people to come and cool off. All kinds of ways to get watered. That was one of the more fun parts of the day, and I have no pictures from it. Oh well. Then the whole group went en masse to the infoshop, which is where I started to feel conflicted about my job a little. Oh well, fuck that. Know the world glued your back to the wall, gotta brawl through that, like Jay z said. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-5.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />They were having a barbeque, vegetarian, of course, and I had my first ever veggie burger. Tasteless, bland, and later my stomach was not happy with me. The vibe I was getting from them was weird: sort of slightly superior defensive insular. I left to get smokes, came back, and some people were hanging out inside, and the feeling was different: we were telling jokes and riddles and just hanging out. So I don't know about that whole situation/group/whatever. Of course, they're all individuals and probably cool taken by themselves. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-6.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />And after that I was pretty exhausted, so I came home and went to bed. I know, boring. <br />Nothing else to report, except I'm editing a new portfolio to go up here soon. We'll see how good it looks, I like the pictures at least. Speaking of pictures: here's one last for your visual enjoyment:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-7.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-7.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

	  So, anyway, It's been a good couple of days. Drove to Durant and back Thursday and Friday. Three hours one way. But then Friday I got my first paycheck, which was totally awesome. Three months with no money really wears on a guy, you know?<br /><br />The driving. God there's a lot of driving. Long stretches of road, hot, way way too hot with my broken air conditioner. My watch thermometer said 110 at one point when I was stuck in traffic on Friday. Is it any wonder people get road rage and hate to drive? I still enjoy it in the morning though. Get up, pack my work-things, go to it. Drinking coffee on the highway, I listen to music and think.<br /><br />What I think is, I'm a vulture. I go around getting photos of all this title research so somebody can buy property, whether it's oil and mineral rights or the surface or whatever. They have to find it though, and get exact legal standings of every little piece. So that's where I come in and photo all the title documents, send them to someone who knows how to decipher what they mean and send that information onto someone else, who then buys or leases rights, and maybe they're extracting something and maybe not. <br /><br />So I'm a little conflicted. I was hanging out with these hippie anarchists (their pamphlets and zines were indicative of this if not the blond dreadlocks many of them sported), and it got me to thinking: What is this concept of big oil, and who decided it was necessarily evil? And am I complicit in working for these people, even at the bottom of a very large hierarchy? <br /><br />Here's what I think: My job would get done anyway. Market forces right now are making oil so valuable that any hole with the least drop of it at the bottom is valuable. I'm not at the top making decisions, and I can't have any effect on the bad things that happen in other countries because of oil. Here in the US at least, there are good laws on the books (and contractual obligations to the surface-rights holders) to maintain the land on the surface. I'm a contract worker for a company that itself has contracts with the people actually digging. I could take any shit job and maybe cover my expenses, but with this job I can cover my expenses, keep my sanity, and be done with my debt much sooner. So it's ok. I think. OK, readers, all five of you: am I selling out?<br /><br />Now I have to go mow grass. More about the rocking weekend later.
