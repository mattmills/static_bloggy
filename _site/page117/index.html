	  <h2><a href="/2008/06/09/weird-search.html">weird search</a></h2>
	  so people are still coming here searching for "Matt Mills porn". You kids are weird. First of all, I don't even have a girlfriend. Second of all, I don't do porn. Artful nudes, maybe, and a friend of mine once asked me to do suicide girl shoot for her, but that never went through and so I really have nothing remotely like porn for you people. <br /><br />Meanwhile, work work work. Went to see Adam yesterday, he seems all right. Broke up as all hell, but all things that'll heal eventually. I'm not a doctor, nor a psychologist,  but I have a feeling he's gonna make a good recovery. Tons of good people around him (I mean all the folks I've met over the last few weeks, the Hellcats and boneshakers and just the community around bikes, really lots of awesome people. <br /><br />I also discovered I don't know how to stick weld at all. I was over at KW's house, he has a workshop and a welding machine. So I decided to build a frankenbike, and then I couldn't put two pieces of metal together to save my life. Although I told my dad what was going on (he's a weldor) and he said it was a case of everything in the situation being wrong, not just that I didn't know any technique. Rod was oxidized and probably too large, so useless. I'll try again next week maybe. Dad said he'd show me some things too, so that'll be cool. <br /><br />And I gotta go sleep. Catch you later, internets.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/06/07/forgetting-names.html">Forgetting names</a></h2>
	  So I'm meeting a bunch of new people, hanging out with more or less the same group for a few weeks, and at times I really feel shitty, because I can't for the life of me remember their names. Actually, it got a lot better tonight (I don't care that the post time says ten something, it's really 3am), there were introductions for someone else new, and I think I'll remember several more now.<br /><br />Adam, who is pictured <a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg">here</a> with his wife, had a really bad wreck. Nobody knows for sure what happened, except some woman saw him come over the side of a bridge over I-44 and stopped to call 911. Multiple injuries, face, knee, ankles, femur, bike's a wreck. I find it hard to believe that all that happened from a fall, but then again, a fall onto concrete from 40 feet (about the height of the bridge) could maybe cause a broken femur. I still think maybe a car was involved. There is maybe a video of the incident, so maybe we can see what happened.<br /><br />It gave me a thought though, about a story I might do. Bike wrecks caused by cars. Close calls. Talk about how scary it is to be out there on the road with a bunch of homicidal maniacs in death machines aimed at you. <br /><br />To tell the truth, I almost didn't ride tonight, I thought about driving. at the last second, i realized it was stupid, that not riding was the worst thing I could do, and so I pedaled up to sauced. And that hand-built wheel I finally put back on the bike? Amazing. Anyway, that's all. I really should offload my card and post pictures, but I'm lazy and tired and I'll do it tomorrow sometime, I swear.

	  <h2><a href="/2008/06/06/work-work-work.html">work, work, work...</a></h2>
	  All week long, so not much to talk about. Although everyone's been asking me wether or not I like my job at work which leads me to believe that someone there has been reading the blog... well, the answer is, I really do like my job. OK? I really like the paycheck, and I know that long term (I'm thinking in years here) it's not what I'm going to end up doing. I get to meet lots of people, push myself in interesting ways. Organization, never my strong suit, is critical, and so I'm learning how to do it. I get to meet interesting people, and one of my strong suits, being endearing to the surly, is a big help some places. <br /><br />My existential doubts the other day (and what I wrote here) were really me thinking out loud. Sometimes I write because I have a good idea, a story to tell. Sometimes I have an idea to work out and if I write it down I can see it better. Then there's what I did the other day: putting my doubts and fears down so I can see if they're real or not after a little time has passed. <br /><br />Now a little time has passed and I've been working and getting a better feel for what is going on, and it's a good thing, for the most part. The problems I have with corporations, big oil, etc. are political problems. This work isn't political in the least. It's just a low level function of a market economy. A demand for information is being filled. <br /><br />Anyway, I need a nap. Photos to follow later, before booze cruise.

	  ...are what the gods gave us to make up for all the shit they put on us. Sometimes, it's enough to make up for it. Sometimes, not so much.<br /><br />Women. What the hell? I thought I'd found someone, and now she's gone off with another guy. (I'm struck now by the recurring themes in my love life, but I digress). How often have I met a woman that I thought was really worthwhile? I'm not talking meet someone who just happens to be smart or sexy and I'm attracted to, but more like love at first sight. You catch a glimpse of her and it's a physical feeling, taking a blow to the head, to the chest, whatever, and you know already that she'll be amazing. <br /><br />It's happened to me three times. I don't know why three, not one or none, I don't know why I'm not still with any of these three wonderful gorgeous smart girls, I don't know a lot of things. My life has been, so far, very much a series of strange and wonderful events that I don't have any hope of understanding.<br /><br />I'll tell the first story, and because she's still around, in the OKC area somewhere, I've gotta come up with an alias. Call her Annie. So, I was in the sixth grade. Walking down a hall at an academic team tourney (jeopardy for schoolkids). we both looked up at the same time, right into each other's eyes, and said "I know you..." Which, of course, we didn't. <br /><br />We talked for a second, and then I didn't see her again until maybe 6 months later. Maybe it was less, maybe it was more.  And I was so inept then that she actually got my phone number first, on some lame excuse. OK, I lied when I used past tense just then. I still suck at details like getting names and numbers. Anyway, we went out for a little less than a year. By then, I was in the eighth grade, and I was talking with my dad, who always has good advice that I don't want to hear, and I could see my whole life stretching out before me. A nice, normal life, go to a state school for free, get a nice job somewhere safe, have my girl with me through the whole thing, yada yada. <br /><br />That's exactly what I thought. How boring. Lame. Go do something fun and exciting with your life. You've gotta burn it up, gotta be more than a cog in a hierarchy of other cogs. Get out of that now, while you can. So, to separate myself from all of that, to cut it off, I did the most destructive thing I could think of: I broke up with the girl I loved. I still don't sleep right.
