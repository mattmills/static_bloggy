  <h2>NOLA and stuff</h2>
  Been a long couple of days. Lot of things happening. Where to begin...<br /><br />New Orleans is an amazing city, the kind of place just on the cusp of some really cool things happening. After disaster comes innovation and change, and it's such a wild place it's bound to come there. It might not have the population to count, but it's such a great combination of cool people and danger and culture and history that things are bound to happen.<br /><br />It was also great to see Jeana and Hope, the real reason I was down there. They act a lot like a married couple, in a funny co-dependent way. Good people, and I'm not just saying that because they read this. Hi Ladies. <br /><br />Also, I drove by the lower 9th ward. It's a whole neighborhood, but subtract all the people and leave the houses to rot for 3 years, and that's what's left. It's shameful and angering, and we should do better. <br /><br />A lot of time in airports. I'm weird in that I really like the airport, even with the bullshit you have to go through to get to the gate. The one thing I don't like is the cramped seats on some of the smaller planes. But airports are such weird inbetween borderlike places that I can't help but love them. <br /><br />And then two days of work. Somehow we ended up talking about politics a lot today, and I have to say it was refreshing. When you talk to people, you actually have to think about why you have your ideas of how things should be and back them up. That and it also sharpens your wits, if you keep thinking after you're done talking, about why and the flaws in what the other person said and how to explain your POV better the next time. <br /><br />Anyway, pictures to follow.
