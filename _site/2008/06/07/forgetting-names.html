  <h2>Forgetting names</h2>
  So I'm meeting a bunch of new people, hanging out with more or less the same group for a few weeks, and at times I really feel shitty, because I can't for the life of me remember their names. Actually, it got a lot better tonight (I don't care that the post time says ten something, it's really 3am), there were introductions for someone else new, and I think I'll remember several more now.<br /><br />Adam, who is pictured <a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg">here</a> with his wife, had a really bad wreck. Nobody knows for sure what happened, except some woman saw him come over the side of a bridge over I-44 and stopped to call 911. Multiple injuries, face, knee, ankles, femur, bike's a wreck. I find it hard to believe that all that happened from a fall, but then again, a fall onto concrete from 40 feet (about the height of the bridge) could maybe cause a broken femur. I still think maybe a car was involved. There is maybe a video of the incident, so maybe we can see what happened.<br /><br />It gave me a thought though, about a story I might do. Bike wrecks caused by cars. Close calls. Talk about how scary it is to be out there on the road with a bunch of homicidal maniacs in death machines aimed at you. <br /><br />To tell the truth, I almost didn't ride tonight, I thought about driving. at the last second, i realized it was stupid, that not riding was the worst thing I could do, and so I pedaled up to sauced. And that hand-built wheel I finally put back on the bike? Amazing. Anyway, that's all. I really should offload my card and post pictures, but I'm lazy and tired and I'll do it tomorrow sometime, I swear.
