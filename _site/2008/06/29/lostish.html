  Feelin' kinda lost tonight, folks. Outside, far away from where I want to be. Half the world, in fact. I dream of running under the desert sun, under fire, not knowing what will happen next or if I will be alive to see it. It's the very edge of everything, chaos, terror, horror, and I really want to go and see it for myself. To take pictures and send them back to people in their calm normal existences, and maybe someone will wake up. <br /><br />The crazy thing is, I can do that. Six months, I'll have the money to go anywhere in the world long enough to make contacts and pictures and sell them and really start a career. It's wild and it's crazy and I'm going to do it. <br /><br />The weird thing, why I'm lost: I'm not where I want to be, but I don't mind where I am. I have a good job, good money, lots of friends. The climate here sucks, and the scenery  is mostly the clouds, but it isn't a bad place. I could hang around here and make a decent life, find some little thing with enough curves and brain cells to keep us entertained, make this job into a career with some law school, and have a good, happy time. <br /><br />I could do that, a nice stable life. Fuck that though. Why be normal when I can live a dream? Why do average when I can do whatever I want? Hotter women, more languages, more danger, more life. Feel every breath, see every person, love them all. Keep shooting and keep shooting until my light goes out. <br /><br />OK, not lost any more. Time to sleep.
