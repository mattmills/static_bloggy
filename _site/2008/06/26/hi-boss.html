  <h2>hi, boss.</h2>
  And hi all the other people. Here's the deal: you can look at the pictures, ignore the writing, and probably get 75% of the good stuff I've put up here. (Theres this <a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/blog/2008/04/destructive-dissassembly.html">one thing</a> I'm proud of, nothing else comes to mind).<br /><br />So yeah, my boss found this site, and called me a serious blogger, and made some joke about terrorism. I don't don't know what that's supposed to mean... I don't think I've ever written about my politics here, and I don't think blowing shit up helps anybody, no matter who's doing it. <br /><br />Really though, there are some serious bloggers out there, but I'm not one. I'm a dilletante, too busy to go hunting links or shit. I just throw up my photos for people to see, tell some stories now and again, lather, rinse, repeat. I don't spell check or proofread, except the casual glances I give my html to see if it'll work. <br /><br />Today was an exceptionally good day though. I went and got some coffee from coffee slingers, which is this trendy place downtown, but they are really good at the whole coffee thing. I had one 12 oz cup and I felt amazing all day. Really good. I felt like a human being, with all the social graces and instincts and quick wit that I sometimes can muster, all from a little paper cup. Like whoa. <br /><br />Got up a little late, thinking I had a shorter drive, but I ended up having to go all the way to (censored). 2 hours. I then shot 3 whole pictures, emailed them to the person chaining the title, and waited a little bit because he said he might need something else. He didn't call, so on I went to (censored), an hour and a half away. Shot for the whole afternoon, didn't do too bad, 500 photos. My half-day record is 1000, whole day is 1800, and I had to get a wrist brace for my right because those days were right together and it's still a little sore. <br /><br />That coffee was really something though. High-test, I'm calling it in my head, like they used to call high octane gas. Better stuff. Makes everything run smoother, more powerful. We'll see tomorrow if it was a fluke or what.
