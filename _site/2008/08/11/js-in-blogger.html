  <h2>js in blogger</h2>
  so anyway, if you want to do any javascript in blogger, you've gotta put in in your template, in the header, to make it work. as far as I can figure. could be I needed ADATA tags, but anyway, there's source now to embed a javascript gallery into blogger in the post below and the header of the blog. This is for people that have their own server space. All the functions are in the header, and the stuff in the post is function calls and definitions, how many photos and where to get them. File names go in the array, and if you name your photos 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg, etc, then you won't have to even change that.<br /><br />I had an awesome weekend though. Crazy coincidences, party, artshow/b-boys. 950 pictures saturday night/sunday morning. I danced! I talked to pretty girls, ran towards a fight, slept on a couch, and had brunch in style on sunday. shitty javascript too, fixed monday in 15 minutes of fresh coding on lunch. also some shitty food sometime before sunday evening made me miss soccer, not the brunch though, that was too soon. <br /><br />Some of the photos below are real keepers, as in they're going in my portfolio. Into the edit I'm doing now at least. I decided that I need the <a href="http://www.adorama.com/INKD700.html">D700</a> beacuse let's face it, I would have a lot less blurries at ISO 25000. and the focusing screen! so much better. It won't make me a better photographer, but it's one hell of a lot sharper knife to cut with, if you can dig it. <br /><br />Video of the sequence of b-boys coming whenever I get my shit together, maybe tomorrow. If it were my job I would have done it sunday. But my job is boring, dull, and unimaginative. Fuck it, I'm going to go do that now. Video before I sleep if it kills me tomorrow.
