  <h2>santa fe dreams</h2>
  Still here. Had a really excellent dinner with Mike and Tina and their lovely daughter who's name I'm drawing a complete blank on. It'll come back to me. Really good food though, I've never had a bad meal there, and the company is extraordinary. It's always a treat. Then, I had a nice talk with (insert youngest daughter's name here, which I now have a major mental block around, even though we've known each other for a few years now) after Mike and Tina went to bed. It's really rare to find someone who I can really talk to, who has interesting things to say, etc. <br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-1.jpg" ></a><br /><br />So, in other news, I got kicked out of Alex's place the other night. Well, first I did a semi-pornographic shoot with Kit, which the roommates didn't like. I can't fathom what a bunch of hetero bachelors would find objectionable about a naked woman in the house, but that's just me. The shoot itself went really well, Kit is happy with the pictures, and you should be able to see them eventually on suicidegirls.com. Yeah, that classy porn site. If such an oxymoron is beyond your ken, sorry. (As an aside, this is the only way I'll do certain kinds of photography: nudes, weddings, and a few others, you have to be my friend first, and ask nicely. I'm likely to do it for free, though). <br /><br /><a href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-2.jpg" ></a><br /><br />What else? Mad drama which is now solved and not worth talking about; staying in andrew's house; and the internet in the hospital is down, so I'm posting tethered to my phone. We blinged alex's walker. Chilled on the plaza. Lots of drinking in small portions, a beer here, a glass of wine there. I haven't been really drunk for several days, though. Now, Photos!
