  <h2>Today couldn't get better...</h2>
  Well, it could, actually, but I don't think it's possible within the bounds of physics and or psychology. My lady, who could improve the situation, is 600 miles away, and there aren't any others. Did I mention the amazing French wine I got for ten bucks? Cote du rhone, no less. <br /><br />Today started out really excellently. I woke up at 2am after 12 hours of sleep, more than I've gotten in almost a week. Then, I read some Don Quixote. Really, if you haven't read this book, you should. Not only for the hilarious moments, but for the ones in which you begin to wonder what is real and what isn't.<br /><br />Coffee with the 'rents. Always a pleasure. Dad wants me to photograph at the Apprentice contest tomorrow. So, I'm getting up at 5am to go shoot pictures. So what else is new?<br /><br />Then he and my mom go off to work, and I get glued to this short story collection, <a href="http://lcrw.net/kessel/">The Baum Plan for Financial Independence by John Kessel</a>. Link goes to a free download page, because sometimes the good things just fly into your hands. <br /><br />So, I pry myself away from the story and head out for adventure. Then I realize I left my outgoing mail on the corner of the desk, so I pull a u turn and go back for it. Then, back on track for adventure. Wherever the wind, my short supply of gas, and my legs will take me. <br /><br />I parked at Bass Pro Shops downtown, and walked toward the city. I knew there had to be a post drop box somewhere in there. I mean, it's a city, right?<br /><br />So I'm walking. I get through Bricktown, which is the entertainment district, and I'm in and among the few skyscrapers OKC has. None are terribly tall, but we at least have an honest skyline. Well, viewed from the east anyway. it kinda sucks from the west. I passed a hotel, asked a dude in a uniform if he knew where a post box would be. He looked at me like I was crazy, from mars or something, and well, to tell the truth, I felt like I was. <br /><br />Lemme back up a little. As I stepped out of the house, I looked around and everything looked profoundly weird. The trees were trees and the grass was grass and the sky was still that faded hazy blue I know all too well, but it seemed like it shouldn't be that way. It was real as a slap in the face, but it seemed wrong, like false notes. And I didn't shake the feeling until much later in the day. It's not something you get used to so much as ignore until you forget. <br /><br />Anyway, the bellhop didn't know where I coud mail my letters, but the concierge did, told me inside the frist national building, down the escalator, and off to the right. And what sould I find when I followed his directions but a full service post office? Very Nice. <br /><br />So then I walked the tunnels that are under OKC for a little bit. I moved maybe five hundred yards along my route, going first east then north, getting lost, and finally deciding that I sould go to the surface, where I had better bearings. <br /><br />As soon as I was back on the surface, I knew where I was, and struck off in the right direction. The Independent Artists' Alice show was up, and I want to smack whoever curated it in the face. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong. There was some exceptional work in the show, some of it even good photography. But the problem is they let in everybody, so it seemed, and as much as a third was crap, and it didn't ever really gel for me as a show. It was a bunch of individual pieces on the wall, and they were in the same gallery, but there was no unity. I really liked some of the individual pieces, though. I'll throw some up when I throw photos up. <br /><br />Then, since I was just around the corner, I went and got a coffee at Java Dave's and said hello to Lora. She was having a shitty day, too many assholes. To the assholes in the world: Be nice to the people that make your food and drinks, because they have a lot of opportunities to fuck with you and you'll never know about it. <br /><br />From there, I wandered a bit more, then hitched a ride with Lora to my car, and came home. Talked to Dillon, he might have a job doing photo for me. Then I went to the liquor store with my dad, found the aforementioned wine, which I need another glass of. Photos to follow soon.
