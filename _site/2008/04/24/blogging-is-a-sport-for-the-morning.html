  <h2>blogging is a sport for the morning...</h2>
  Here I am, it's morning, hello everyone. Been a bit since I rapped at ya, been busy. Every thing is up in the air, and with a little luck, I'll keep it all that way. All china and razor blades, flying around my head, propelled there by me.<br /><br />I'm so incredibly stoked about Gestalt it's not even funny. Every single one of the editors are singularly amazing, and I'm glad as hell they're working with me. Hey, sometimes to get the best people all you have to do is ask them. We had our first meeting on tuesday, and it was a blast. They've all got great ideas, and they're on board for the direction I'd like to see the magazine go in, in terms of how it's run and whatnot. So that's great. Deadline for the first issue is next wednesday.<br /><br />I haven't been wandering about as much of late, mostly because my longtime wandering partner has been busy. Today, though, there is the arts fest, which should be great. I'm gonna go down and see what kind of trouble I can get myself into. now, photos.<br /><br />When I saw these pieces of pipe cut, I thought they must have a macine to make the edges so even; turns out that's just how well my dad can use a torch.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />This is the dude that won, TIG welding.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Georgie, waiting for the winners to be announced.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />And the Winner is... Erica.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>That's all for now. More stuff amd more interesting photos later.
