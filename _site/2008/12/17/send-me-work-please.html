  <h2>send me work please</h2>
  because, well, my camera is starting to go bad. The LCD has been sketchy for months, and now the mode dial doesn't work right- it will just change modes at random. I'm going to have to buy a new one. I've got a nikon d700 in mind. Camera plus a new 50mm lens plus batteries equals 2700 bucks, give or take, from B&H. <br /><br />the best way you could help me is maybe if you know someone that has photography needs, maybe you could let them know you just saw this awesome photographer on the web (for those who don't know me personally) or you know this guy who's a really awesome photographer (for those who do). I'm $500 a day (plus expenses, large travel costs have to be up front at this point) for most kinds of work, minimum half day charge unless it's a one shot deal like a headshot. The general rule is if I shoot for an hour, I'm editing for two, and there's half the day shot by the time I burn files to a disk or send them via ftp or whatever. I can still do work with the camera, and if I could get a couple assignments, I could manage a new one. <br /><br />so I've added a donation button over to one side, too. if anybody feels inclined to donate to the cause, feel free. I'm not about to stop doing what I'm doing, unless the camera really does die. in that case, I'll bleg some more.
