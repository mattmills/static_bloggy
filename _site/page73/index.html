	  So I have a huge pile of photos from the last week, and I've been procrastinating on posting them because of work and lazyness and such, but here, finally, on a coffee fueled sunday night, I've gotten them all out and will post them in blog-sized chunks until I get bored with them and post all the rest in a large-ish post sometime on tuesday.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Mom on her first day as a retiree. Lunch at Olive Garden.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >This dude was sort of bewildered at the camera. Also, he took the next photo, of Christa and me. Bewildered by focus as well. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Yeah, that's me.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/08/11/booze-cruise-meets-broquest.html">Booze Cruise Meets BROQUEST</a></h2>
	  Or at least one of the members of BROQUEST was there. All in all, a fun night. I keep hearing that other people are doing booze cruise on saturdays now, if that's true could someone tell me? Chris? I just want to drink and ride bikes with people, and who cares what night it's on, right? <br /><br />Anyway, between last week's illness, starting the new job, and all the things I was doing over the weekend, I've been neglecting all the backend stuff- editing, organizing, and blogging. It's tiring, and the list of things I need to get done tomorrow is a mile and a half long. May or may not do all/some of it. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  I felt kinda really off shooting saturday, ended up dancing as much as photographing. That's what I get for eating a whole hot n ready sausage pizza. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >This girl had everything I look for in a woman: 1. a camera 2. madness 3. the tendency to flip shit and run off.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/anothernormansat/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Cameron, also late of BROQUEST, although he finished in a different place. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/anothernormansat/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was a complete accident.
