	  <h2><a href="/2008/10/29/my-method.html">my method</a></h2>
	  Several people have asked me recently "how do you get pictures like that?" or "What lens do you use?" or the like. I usually answer in my most serious voice: "Magic."<br /><br />The truth is, I have a certain technique that I use that I've developed over the years (almost ten years doing photography, now). I've spent a lot of time studying light. I've read every book of technique I could get my hands on. But the true technique is not found in a book; it is what happens when everything action is completely unpremeditated; there is no camera, there is no lens, no thoughts of exposure or aperture; there is only the picture. <br /><br />Of course, to achieve this Zen state, there's a lot of practice and fumbling and mistakes. The best photographers are humble, generous sorts, because everyone has, at least once, dropped some piece of equipment worth more than their car. I'm kind of a klutz. I dropped a lens last saturday (and no, that won't date this little essay, because I do stupid shit often and still make good pictures). It is always looking through the viewfinder. I forget everything else in the whole world. <br /><br />To get there is a matter of a lot of practice. I used to shoot with an all manual leica, and it was the simplest most perfect camera ever. If I could just stick a sensor behind that thing that would spit out raw files, I would be obscenely happy. Leica, unfortunately f'ed up their digital camera so bad I found it almost unusable. I really have to be digital for two reasons: Time and money. <br /><br />So, that out of the way, there are some technical things that I do differently, at least somewhat. I always shoot with a fairly large aperture and high ISO. I own three different 50mm f/1.2 lenses, for different cameras (I have owned in the past a total of nine or ten lenses in 50mm focal length, not counting zooms or lenses in the similar 40mm length). I used to always meter with an incident light meter, set a manual exposure, and roll through a scene; now I use aperture priority because my camera has a meter inside. It works most of the time. <br /><br />I use manual focus a lot; enough that I have a dedicated manual lens. with af there is a tendency to not move the camera around; the focus points are where some designgeneer put them, and not where you want them. <br /><br />I can't say much more that I do, really; I play around a lot with composition and angle. Find interesting things to photograph. People are the most interesting to me. All of them. that's all.

	  I've felt really weird over the last week. I bonked my head, quit my job (for good this time), had totally wild nights and good days, and I feel wonderful for all of it.<br /><br />Quitting my job was probably the best thing I've done since I started the job. If you're not doing what you want to be doing with your life, fucking stop that shit. Do better things.<br /><br />There was this bonfire, lots of people, fire:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-1.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-2.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-3.jpg"  />And yes, I know this is a cliche. Oh well. Reagan and Lauren:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-4.jpg"  />Erin hit a nail right before getting to sauced friday:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-5.jpg"  />Curt (sorry if that's the wrong spelling), and I have no idea where he got that hat:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-6.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-7.jpg"  />Ash, new in town:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-8.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-9.jpg"  />And then with the wig and glasses, the random costumery this guy finds, I don't know:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-10.jpg"  /><br /><br />Then there was the cupping on saturday, a coffee tasting. It was interesting, although I have to say that whenever I'm on the sport to come up with words for taste, I draw a blank. It was cool though. Part of the random goodness of the week. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-11.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-12.jpg"  /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-13.jpg"  />

	  <h2><a href="/2008/10/13/my-weekend.html">My weekend</a></h2>
	  Finally over. I'm sort of still waiting for the other shoe to drop, as it were, but the disaster might be over (as I write that, I knock the wood of my desk firmly). <br /><br />It started well enough- got off work, came home, and apparently picked up my friend Traci to go into town for booze cruise. I say apparently because I can't remember. This is reconstructed memory and could be wrong. We get to Regan's house and start biking from there to get Vietnamese food. While on the way or the return, I'm not sure which, I was riding no-handed, and because of the damage I did to my bike last weekend with my car rack, it was a little more unstable than I'm used to and the front wheel did something funny and I went down.<br /><br />I landed on my right side. That wasn't a problem; my right side is as tough as my left, and my left is as tough as many. No, the problem is that no matter how tough you are, the concrete always wins against your skull. For illustration, see the photo in my previous post. <br /><br />In my memory, there is a big blank between leaving El Reno on Friday and early Saturday morning. If we include vague memories and flashes, my memory goes to about 6 in the evening, and picks up again at 2am. Traci and Reagan told me that for about two hours after the wreck, I was babbling the same two minutes of conversation:<br /><br />"How did I get here? I fell? Has someone checked for a concussion?..." and then a restart two minutes later, as everything that was happening to me failed to get into long term memory. <br /><br />Thanks to Reagan and Traci, though. They've got to be saints or angels, taking care of me like that. <br /><br />So, I got home around 6am- Traci drove my car to her house out in choctaw, and then I drove myself home from there. Can't blame her for driving the first leg, as I wasn't terribly lucid for most of the night. I checked my eyes one last time, not because I couldn't remember them being fine, but because I was paranoid about going to sleep and slipping into a coma. I was fine, went to sleep. <br /><br />That's not the end of the story. I woke up sore but mostly all right. I figured I should go back out, show everyone that I was fine, etc. This was a bad idea.<br /><br />I drove to sauced with my bike on the back of the car. Went in, got a slice, chatted a little bit, found out there was something going on at the conseratory, a club way north on western. I finished my slice, said to myself "hell, why not?"<br /><br />So I'm riding up there on my bike. I see a place that looks open, says Bar on the sign, but I get closer and realize it says "Make Up Bar" and despite the lights being on (should have been my first clue, most bars here black out their windows) they were closed. So I'm leaving the parking lot, and there's a couple lights out, and I hadn't truned on my headlight yet, and out of nowhere, this curb/island is in front of me, maybe two feet wide, and I hit it hard. I hit the pavement harder. <br /><br />As I'm falling, I have time to think. I say to myself at least I'm wearing a helmet this time, but it's too bad there's nobody here to see. Just before I hit the concrete, I think, yeah, there's nobody to pick me up either. <br /><br /><span >Impact.</span><br /><br />I laid there for a minute, inventorying myself, realizing my neck hurt, but if it was broken, I was fucked anyway. I screamed a great gutteral curse, and sat up. The kind of word Tom Waits gargles in the morning after he brushes his teeth. With thorns. I stand up with no less effort, but a lot less whining, and go on to the club. What else?<br /><br />The club was dead. More than dead, it was goth night. I went in, found out there's no live acts, and gave up for good. Rode back to sauced, and on the way, I lost my hat. The hat was in my back pocket while I was wearing my helmet. Gone. So I made myself scarce too. <br /><br />But sunday was solid. I slept in, woke up in pain, ans sat around for most of the day. Spent a few hours at coffee slingers drinking the best coffee in town, and that helped a lot. I'm still limping around a bit, but its cool. My neck is sore, it hurts to laugh still, but I'm alive.
