	  Mike J's. At the Sipango. And you might think, from these pictures, that it's not a bad place to hang out. You'd be wrong. I wouldn't go there again unless it's someone's birthday, and they won't see reason and come to a bar with less dudebros. The things we do for our friends. Actually, I only stayed for half an hour, everybody was already pretty well wasted by the time I got there. Although I did have dinner and some beers earlier at Mcnellies that night, I wasn't <span >drinking</span>, if you know what I mean. Tuesday, you know? <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  You know, you;d think the office christmas party would be boring, and nothing would really happen. And I suppose I did end up driving myself home that night, so it wasn't that crazy. But still, it requires two posts to get all the photos in. Here: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0023.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0024.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0025.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0026.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0027.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0028.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0029.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0030.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  I took all these photos. Ok, in that last post, where I said I hadn't taken any good ones of Ali when we were celebrating her bday? I lied. There's one here that I really like and another that's all right, but it's not her face. What else? That was a dfry night, which is becoming more and more common now that blue note has changed the jukebox. My favorite bar is changing owners very soon... this has happened once before, and that change brought us ladies night and free pool afternoons, but we lost good show coming out of there, so maybe this time we'll keep the free beer and get back some awesome shows. <br /><br />Then there are the two pictures in here that aren't portraits. I'm becoming more impulsive with my photography, and that off ramp was an extreme example. I glanced out of the bar door, saw something, and had a compulsion to go out and shoot it. That's all I came up with; although there are several frames, I only like that one. What else? Holly, you'd better be treating my hat well. Regular walks, exercise, hand wash only. Now I have to get photos off the camera. <br /> <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0043.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0044.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0045.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0046.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0047.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0048.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0049.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0050.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0051.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0052.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  I was at the blue note... this was the night I found out someone new was buying it, definitely bittersweet... but the sweet was good, too, Hanging out w/ Kat and Sigrid and Kat's fam (her dad is a pool shark, watchout), and then just the drinking, oh, the drinking... <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
