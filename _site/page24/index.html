	  <h2><a href="/2010/08/17/roller-derby.html">Roller Derby</a></h2>
	  <p>The same day as barcamp (man, I was tired when I started that day, and near dead by the end), I went to my first banked-track roller derby match, between the Red Dirt Rebellion, and some team from florida. <span class="caps">RDR</span> lost, but it was fun to watch and take photos of, anyway. The long lens shots were with my trusty 500mm mirror lens. Manually focused pictures of fast movement at slow shutter speeds. That&#8217;s why I make the big bucks (somebody hire me please?).</p>

	  <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=10222">Warren Ellis</a> is the craziest most obscene dude on the internet (at least, of the people that aren't dysfunctional lunatics): 

<blockquote>... It should really be a sort of Paul Schraderesque “well, we did a pile of cocaine the size of Sally Field, and then it turned out it was actually just Sally Field covered in cocaine, so we all did her, even Robert Towne’s dog, and then we ramraided a store and stole twelve typewriters, and then Peter Boyle beat us all unconscious and shoved peyote down our throats, and when we came to he was gone and there was just the typewriters and a loaded gun, so we menaced all the typewriters with the gun until one of them shat out the script we wanted, and somehow three weeks had gone by, and John Milius came by with a surfboard and a harpoon gun and said ‘let’s find us an artist’ and…”</blockquote>

	  <p>Love, man, that&#8217;s a tough one. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense. <a href="http://xkcd.com/55/">My normal approach is useless here</a>. Not that I&#8217;d try to do math on it, but it&#8217;s definitely one of those areas where <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/what-i-learned-in-college-the-world-doesnt-make-any-sense/4153727?productTrackingContext=search_results/search_shelf/center/1">the world doesn&#8217;t make any sense</a>. Is is bad that all of my thoughts can be summed up in links? the best, though, is the blockquote <a href="http://blog.tonypierce.com/2010/08/lost-bet-and-had-to-watch-bachelorette.html">from tony pierce</a>:<br />
	<blockquote>but when it comes to love, real love, long lasting forever and ever love, the type of love that means everything, and fuels everything, and creates magic that last for generations &#8211; well that love is worth climbing every mountain and fording through every stream.</p>
<p>that love is worth putting your perspective partner through every test and exercise, and more importantly yourself through tough questions and tougher actions</p>
<p>which sometimes means you&#8217;ll be alone for a while.</p>
<p>miles davis was known for his amazing music</p>
<p>but i will submit that it was the silence in between the notes that made him legendary.</p>
<p>as depeche mode once suggested</p>
<p>enjoy the silence.</p>
<p>and pray for those who sleep on couches, those who propose on tv, and especially those who struggle with change.</blockquote></p>
<p>Some notes: I&#8217;ve decided, with the help of my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/thedauthi">@thedauthi</a> on twitter that there is an <span class="caps">XKCD</span> for anything nerd related. Also, that book was something I did my sophomore year in college, and you shouldn&#8217;t buy it. Buy <a href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/909837">this one</a> instead. And always listen to the Blogfather about love.</p>
