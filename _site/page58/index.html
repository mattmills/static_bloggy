	  first one will be brief. This is from two wednesdays ago, for once I wasn't out at blue note, and Chelsea came down to get a cell phone (I have spares and hers was spastic). While I was looking for the charger, she says, "Why don't we go to norman and see my friends play a jazz set?" and of course I went. I always have some fantastic luck when I hang out with her; I met a former South African paratrooper at one party, or there was the time we came across fire-dancers just before a rock show, etc, etc. This time, one of the professors from OU showed up and asked to sit in, and dude was cool. Didn't hog the stage, played a couple good numbers, and left. And my five minutes were up a while ago: <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Trumpet playin' man.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><br />More later.

	  It seems like every weekend, we have and excuse to party... and if there is no party, we at least have a reason to drink. Anyway, I know these are like a week and a half late, but I really had far too much fun at this party and the day after... I've had a lot of good days in the past moth or so, and this was one of them (or at least that night and the next morning). The kind of good time that makes me want to hang onto certain pictures, even though they're not as good. When I rush to post, that's when you see 40 pictures split into two posts; when I wait, you get 7 pictures in one post, but I think they're the best 7. Anyway, on with the show: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  So, a couple weeks ago now, I was in the Drunken fry and some dudebro tried to steal my hat and then start a fight with Cody. This was a mistake on his part, and, well, nothing happened, not really. But I'd been avoiding the fry after that, because who wants to deal with that shit? Anyway, last friday a bunch of us started the night getting smashed and playing dominoes, at which point going to the fry sounded like a good idea. And then there weren't enough seats in the car, so I said "Fuck it, I'll ride my bike." And it was awesome and cold, but mostly awesome. And then drunken, and then fries, in phases. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/12/09/friendsgiving-part-2.html">friendsgiving part 2</a></h2>
	  Some good discussion over on my facebook with Kris Kanaly re: that last post where I said the oughts sucked in a lot of ways. If you can read it you should, I don't feel like re-hashing a lot of stuff here. A note on the nature of this blog: I post the photos for other people to see, and I write stuff for myself. It's always rough and nothing I say here is ever final or complete. Also: I didn't mean that there was nothing good happening anywhere, just that only a few pieces of art (and by art I mean writing, painting , photography, and any creative endeavour) were what I'd call transformative, that stick with you, that change you, that have a lasting effect. Then I realized, on reflection, that a small number of works like that might be normal. Not that the worlds sucks, but you don't make the mona lisa every day, either. A fault, but I think the rest of the argument stands- reducing noise and increasing good signal is a good thing. Anyway, on with the photos. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Apples to apples, which is an excellent idea while drunk, even though I lost a lot.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Fixing the flag. also: Permanent Distress would be a good name for a punk band.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0014.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/friendsgiving/0015.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Hot ass.
