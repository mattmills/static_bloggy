	  <h2><a href="/2010/08/26/sunday-funday.html">sunday funday</a></h2>
	  <p>This was a couple sundays ago. Man was I tired. Actually, these might have been on two different days, but at least they feel like the same day. The way the days have been run together the last couple of weeks, I&#8217;m not even sure which way is up sometimes. Maybe it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m really tired right now, too.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had the air conditioner on in my house since the weather first cooled off on tuesday. Why waste money? It&#8217;s so nice outside I&#8217;m just letting that good air in. The smell reminds me of the mountains, the air around santa fe. Strong memories, good times. Here and now, the only way to be.</p>

	  <p>You wouldn&#8217;t think there would be photos from an adventure out to lake Arcadia to see the Perseid meteor shower, but then you aren&#8217;t me. It all started at Heather&#8217;s going away party. There were a few drinks (though not a lot, not by a damn sight) and somebody mentioned it, and then the next thing you know five of us were cramming into Heather&#8217;s car (after dumping some of her jut-packed things into the back yard) and pushing off.</p>

<p>Moments after I took that, I had this impulse to stick my head out the window, to try to get a clearer picture of the road. Of course my hat was instantly blown off, so we had to go back and get it. Heather found it. Holly found a frisbee. Then we got back on the road, and got there without too many problems (although I was the only person who had a flashlight).</p>

The meteors, it seemed, hadn&#8217;t gotten the memo. Only a few of them came.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/before_egypt1/0022.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /></p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t matter though. We all saw a few, although we didn&#8217;t all see the same ones. There were wonderful moments whenever a couple of us would see the same one and say &#8220;There&#8217;s one!&#8221; at the same time. Also, not pictured: the four moons of Jupiter that we could see through Holly&#8217;s binoculars. Finally, I have to brag a little: that picture, the one below? Taken with only starlight. <span class="caps">BOO</span>-<span class="caps">YAH</span>.</p>

	  <p>So, I booked my hostel, and everything is coming along swimmingly. I&#8217;m just gonna vomit up a bunch of posts really quickly because I don&#8217;t have time to space things out any more. Get ready for an overload of Photos.</p>

	  <p>(mom: ignore this) A little known secret about me: I only smoke because I like the way that smoke looks in the air. Which is also why I just barely smoke.</p>
