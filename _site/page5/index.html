	  <p>This shit was a blast. seriously a lot of fun. As in, we&#8217;re going to have to do it again. Thanks to (in no particular order): Amber (hair and makeup), Brian (lights/grip), KJ, and Meghan (models). Anyway, yeah. Photos. I&#8217;m splitting this into two posts to ease the server load. Next one in a hot minute.</p>

<p>the patio is still the best place in the city to get some air and a bite at the same time. it&#8217;s going to be a regular stop for me as soon as they get real beer.</p>

	  <p>Speaking of the city, I was riding around the other day, and had another one of those moments, where I saw something that caught me. I took this photo:</p>

<p>Something about the combination of being in a big space (the structures always have that effect on me; I realize how much sky there is up there) and all the activity of construction made the growth the city is experiencing real to me. Like before, it was politicians talking about it, people bitching about it never going to happen, and here we are. It could be nice. Let&#8217;s make it nice.</p>
