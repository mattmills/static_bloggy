	  <p>And by pre-gaming, I mean I went to a show, to warm me up for all the other shows. I could have used a drink, as this was a TV taping and all those cameras made me kinda nervous, but after a couple takes I got used to them and was able just to enjoy the music. 
<br/><br/>
Why I was there exactly is a little complicated- a friend is a PA or something for the show, and I ran into her when I was in Stillwater a couple months ago at a show, and she asked me to do some stills for them, so I did. And I guess as a thank-you and because they needed warm bodies in the seats, I got to go to the on set taping of the show, Warehouse something or other.

I&#8217;m kinda in love with what that lens can do.

	  <p>Today is a weird ass day&#8230; I keep doing that thing you&#8217;re supposed to do in lucid dreams where you look at everything twice, to tell if I&#8217;m awake or not. Man, people in the hospital, (everyone is fine now as far as I know) sudden revelations, breakfast tacos, madness.  
<br/><br/>
Yesterday, I lost my voice. I said to Reaghan: &#8220;I took a shot of Tom Waits,&#8221; because when I could talk, that&#8217;s who I sounded like. This morning, eating my taco, I heard in my head his reading of Bukowski&#8217;s poem &#8220;Nirvana&#8221;: &#8220;Not much chance. Completely cut loose from purpose&#8230;&#8221; Oh the <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-have-an-ipodin-my-mind,10912/" target="_blank">ipod of the mind</a>. 
<br/><br/>
Anyway, here are some entirely unrelated photos:

	  <p>I&#8217;ve been volunteering at the <a href="http://scissortailokc.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Scissortail social space</a> the last couple weeks, helping out with their bike shop- it&#8217;s all pay as you can/free. If you&#8217;re having bike problems, come by wednesday after 2, and I&#8217;ll be glad to help. I mean, look at that truing stand.

They also have a decent-sized lending library, lots of good books that I have a feeling are hard to find in the MLS libraries. So come hang out, have some coffee (if we have any) and fix yo&#8217; bike. It&#8217;s just south of the corner of 30th and walker, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;q=3012+N.+Walker+Oklahoma+City,+OK&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=3012+N+Walker+Ave,+Oklahoma+City,+Oklahoma,+73103&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=o0jTS8r1OcT_lgel_rjsDA&amp;ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA&amp;ll=35.500107,-97.521622&amp;spn=0.008044,0.012767&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.500164,-97.521014&amp;panoid=HTWxLowF16IFz1QCax8YGA&amp;cbp=12,102.31,,0,-5.13" target="_blank">right here</a>, next to the AA Food Mart.</p>

	  <p>I&#8217;ve been working from the <a href="http://okccoco.com" target="_blank">OKC CoCo</a> for the last month or so now, and it&#8217;s a really great environment. I mean, not to sound like an advertisement. The concept of it is solid, though. Mostly, it&#8217;s getting work done, but there are all these really smart people around, also working, to bounce ideas off of and build relationships with. Most places I go it&#8217;s very hard to talk about my day job, the things I have to bitch about don&#8217;t even make sense to people who haven&#8217;t struggled with what turns out to be a missing } 300 lines up for hours. Anyway, yeah:

Full disclosure: I get my membership in exchange for shooting events for the CoCo.</p>
