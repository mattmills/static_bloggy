	  So these are the last of them, except a coupla skate sequences... This was fun. And now, I've got a regular job, I'm going to be boring, but the good news is it's at least interesting work... learning a new programming language, plus a library or two, plus a new super complicated framework... all marketable skills, things I can use to get a job telecommuting from anywhere. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >"hey guys, let's go get food and make a big brunch."</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0072.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Made their money back, at least. </span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0073.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Feast in preparation.

	  I was going to just be lazy and post the photos to flickr and be done, but some of these need captions and comments and snarkiness. Also, I think more people will see them this way. These are split into three posts, so as not to hurt your page load time and my bandwidth.<br /><br />Oh yeah, a technical note- these pictures wouldn't have been possible without clever deployment of the on camera flash and a little reflector to bounce it off of the ceiling/walls.
