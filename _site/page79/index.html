	  <span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />After pride, there was this cookout, with a bunch of excellent food. The chef from Cafe 7, which is on the northside somewhere (chime in in the comments if you know where it is). F'ing amazing ziti, pretty good kebabs, pesto crusted grilled chicken, it was nice. Some days I forget to eat until late in the day, and then circumstance prevents it for a couple more hours, and then I'm rewarded for the wait with a meal like that. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />It was really nice, but I wish I had more photos of the whole thing. Like I said, I was having an off day sunday, maybe because of the lack of sustenance. I had to let the hate pass before I could even look at the photos again, that's why I took these sunday and you're just now seeing them.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, I'm several days out from my last cup of coffee. I think that's what I'll go do now. That and get ready for TULSA: THE SEQUAL. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/06/30/pride-parade.html">Pride Parade</a></h2>
	  So, it's pride 09. I wasn't on, but these I like. For those who don't know: I'm straight. And I'm not going to lie, this was mostly about being a part of the spectacle and drinking and cooking out for me. But yes, I do support a whole range of gay rights, marriage and equal protection and other things. But this was a party on wheels. <br /><br />I'd like to say the big fail is because of the lack of intimacy with the subject(true), or sub-standard camera equipment(not true), but really it was because I lacked two things: focus and a camera strap. I wasn't focused on taking pictures, more on riding the new bike, and I didn't have a strap to hold the camera so I was constantly death gripping it and worried I would drop it. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Two days before, but already started at the Copa.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >The Bike Horde.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was something about people wearing leather and being gay? Not sure. update from my friend hope who Knows Things: "The picture at the pride parade the people in leather. Its the national leather association. that's what the blue and black flag with the red heart represents. its a BDSM community with a very strong Gay following. I know i always have the strangest information. but there you go."</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >This really surprised me; Dell is a big company, glad to see that they were out there in support.

The pride pictures are mostly edited, they'll be along sometime soon.
