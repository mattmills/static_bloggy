	  First off, I'm writing this in a bit of a rush, scratching off that last to do item from my list before I hit the door. The Regular Wednesday sesh was a lot of fun; not only did we hit the litter box, but we rode around and hit some spots as well. Down by the chase building, a little bricktown love, and then we rocked up the monster hill. It's the only monster in town, another sign that OKC isn't a real city. Anyway, photos:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I love how everyone's starting to get the no handed shit down pat, or at least look good for the thirtieth of a second I need to get the photos. Nice to see hornbeck in town, too, and on his new whip no less.<br /><br />So anyway, that's all folks, I'm out. I'm going to try to shoot and post from the road, we'll see how well that works. I'll be twittering, at least. On the flip side.

	  no time to post thouroughly, but topic for later: why the hell aren't we doing our dream jobs? Or busting ass to work towards them? Not allowed to use the words "in these difficult economic times" or anything of the like. The time to do that shit is now, easy or hard.

	  But the volume knob <a href="http://paulsboutique.beastieboys.com">here</a> is pretty badass. Actually yesterday I was talking mad shit on flash for web design because it usually sucks and just does the same stuff that you can do faster and better in javascript... but this I have no idea how I'd do, and it's a cool effect.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/02/02/new-furniture.html">New Furniture...</a></h2>
	  So I got a new couch today, courtesy of Grant (hi grant). The best way to get me to clean is to move furniture, and/or get new furniture. Something about rearranging everything makes me want to organize all my crap and throw away all the various detritus I collect over time. So, after sleeping through the super bowl, I started to work. <br /><br />The room actually seemed to get worse for the first couple hours, so I paused, laid on the new loveseat and listened to tom waits, which for some reason motivated me. <span >Nighthawks at the Diner</span> for anyone who cares. <br /><br />I don't throw away all of my junk; I'm enough of a romantic that some stuff I keep around for sentimental value alone. I have bits and pieces of most of the cameras I've owned over the years for example. The ones that weren't stolen, that is. Certain pictures, too, I just can't part with or throw away prints of, even if they're a little damaged. The tech stuff I'm pretty good about trashing once it's past its prime. So, because it's such a rare occurrence, I give you my room, as clean as it gets:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/clean_room.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Also yesterday, I had my first gig with Take Two productions, and let me say it's nice to work with professionals. I was running the wider of the two video cameras, something I've never done before (all my video experience has been single-camera work, documentary, and as cheap as possible). It took me a few numbers, but I got the hang of it. It didn't help that I was on an hour and a half of sleep; I probably would have been a bit quicker on the uptake, a little smoother, if I had been able to sleep saturday night. Or at night at all; It's 5am and my super nap ended around 9pm. <br /><br />Anyway, I might end up preferring to run video on these gigs, given that I get more work from take 2; there's less pressure. We'll see. I haven't done stills for them yet, and I'd like to try that too; It's more in my bones to do stills. This site isn't "videographermattmills" for a reason. Anyway, my newly clean and cleared bed is calling my name.
