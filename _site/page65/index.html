	  This is all from last wednesday... so I'm only a week behind now... really the problem is me. I have everything I've shot up to yesterday edited and ready to post, but I'm lazy or reluctant to post everything all at once or something.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Soccer field very early/very late the night before.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/donwannagohome/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Kamp's, which is technically not a club, since they're sketchy like that.

	  blame it on the busted macbook (parts are on their way from hong kong, and we all know how long it takes a slow boat from china to get here...) or blame it on being bummed about not getting the magazine job I thought I was a shoe-in for, or, well, general laziness, but anyway, here are some pics from sunday before last, more shooting for the <a href="http://thenakedsun.com">naked sun</a>, which is still in progress and might actually be the saving of us all, if by us all I mean media/art people that would like to make money and keep on doing our thing at the same time. <br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nakedsunouttakes/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nakedsunouttakes/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nakedsunouttakes/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nakedsunouttakes/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos" />

	  <span class="caption" >This dude's name was Izzy. I think.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0023.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />So, I was just riding my bike around, the middle of the night being the best time for it, and I happened to turn down in to a neighborhood. I thought maybe there would be a way through to the next block, and sometimes there are even people out on their porches, partying, and that's always good for a drink or two. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >This chick put on an awesome impromptu set. I'd listen to her again, even buy a cd, if I knew who she was of if she had recordings. Anybody know? edit to add: several people have told me that this is Ali harter. Thanks.<br /></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0024.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I couldn't have been more wrong. I mean, the neighborhood was all dead end cul de sacs and turned in on itself- the way I came in was the only way in or out. It was <span >quiet</span>, too. Like zombie movie quiet, all the houses dark, not even a television flickering that I saw. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Ed and Victoria.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0025.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I kept cruising, slowly, looking for some sign of life. I was about to give up and leave the neighborhood, and three big dogs jumped out of their doghouse, running and barking. Then, I saw the fence between me and them, and pressed down the little panic reflex. Not wanting to push my luck, I got the hell out of that weird neighborhood.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Katie, no metal face.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0026.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />And then I found five dollars. (Not really, but Alex told me to say that when I tell a story that has no real point, so people don't feel cheated for reading it). <br /><br /><span class="caption" >I think he name is Meg? (edit: jennifer. not even close there, bub. ther real question: where do I know a meg zinkly?). Cool chick, does good designs.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0027.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>

	  I'm not sure what the theme or the unifying whatever was for this street fest, but I think it might have been "Mess with the drunks," viz:<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0012.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />And then the dragon chased Victoria and Beach.<br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0013.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0014.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption"  >Tim, we need to talk.
