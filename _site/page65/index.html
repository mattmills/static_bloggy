	  <span class="caption" >This dude's name was Izzy. I think.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0023.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />So, I was just riding my bike around, the middle of the night being the best time for it, and I happened to turn down in to a neighborhood. I thought maybe there would be a way through to the next block, and sometimes there are even people out on their porches, partying, and that's always good for a drink or two. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >This chick put on an awesome impromptu set. I'd listen to her again, even buy a cd, if I knew who she was of if she had recordings. Anybody know? edit to add: several people have told me that this is Ali harter. Thanks.<br /></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0024.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I couldn't have been more wrong. I mean, the neighborhood was all dead end cul de sacs and turned in on itself- the way I came in was the only way in or out. It was <span >quiet</span>, too. Like zombie movie quiet, all the houses dark, not even a television flickering that I saw. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Ed and Victoria.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0025.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I kept cruising, slowly, looking for some sign of life. I was about to give up and leave the neighborhood, and three big dogs jumped out of their doghouse, running and barking. Then, I saw the fence between me and them, and pressed down the little panic reflex. Not wanting to push my luck, I got the hell out of that weird neighborhood.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Katie, no metal face.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0026.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br />And then I found five dollars. (Not really, but Alex told me to say that when I tell a story that has no real point, so people don't feel cheated for reading it). <br /><br /><span class="caption" >I think he name is Meg? (edit: jennifer. not even close there, bub. ther real question: where do I know a meg zinkly?). Cool chick, does good designs.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0027.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>

	  <h2><a href="/2009/10/05/being-lost.html">being lost</a></h2>
	  Yesterday or the day before, sunday, anyway, I was driving down the highway and I had this sudden feeling of disconnectedness, of being lost. Like when in the night you wake up and don't know where you are. <br /><br />I was coming around a curve, and it was raining, cloudy, but I know that section of road, have driven it many times. There's the normal state of having been somewhere, and you remember, for example, that the bathroom is behind you and your car is out in the parking lot or driveway, and that the roads that led you there also lead to home. It's a grounded feeling, a feeling that lets you ignore parts of the landscape that aren't normal. <br /><br />For a brief second, coming around that curve, it was like all those connections, where I was going and where I was coming from, and everything that I knew the location of, all of that was cut off, and it was as if I was floating above it. It's so odd because I normally have a very good sense of the space I'm in and what is around me. <br /><br />Then, I looked around I saw every detail of everything, blades of grass and tree branches, and the cars a quarter mile back, and the shapes of the clouds, and then, gradually, over a period of ten seconds, the feeling faded, and while I didn't feel really normal for a couple minutes, the hyper-awareness was gone and the highway was just highway, and the sky was just sky, and the weirdness went away, just like it does when you turn on the light in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Anyway, now back to your regularly scheduled blog. There's some nice pics from plaza fest and outtakes from the naked sun shoot coming up, so stay tuned.

	  All of these need captions, but instead of me writing them, you should pull out a sharpie and write them in in the whitespace between the pictures. No, not really. Seriously though, the conference was really fun, I learned a lot about podcasting and a little about blogging. Breakfast from prairie thunder, coffee from cafe evoke and lunch from iguana, all wonderful. It was nice to meet everyone, and hopefully you all like the photos. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0005.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0006.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0007.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0008.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0009.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0010.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0011.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0012.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0013.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0014.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0015.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0016.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>
