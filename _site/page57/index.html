	  Remember? The night that I drank far far too much? Excessive amounts of excess. So hungover in the morning I couldn't move? Yeah, well, there was this artshow, and I was broke, and a lot of other people fed me booze, but I wasn't really keeping track. I started counting in the morning, and the number of drinks I had was some where in excess of <span >way too many</span>. I think my short term memory shorted out there at the end, I have a lot of the same picture, like I took it and then forgot. Not that I remember now, but the photos at least tell something. Artifacts. Thank god for autofocus. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >I know, deadpan images are dead, but I liked the asshole tax.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Husband...<br/></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >and wife.<br/></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />

	  first one will be brief. This is from two wednesdays ago, for once I wasn't out at blue note, and Chelsea came down to get a cell phone (I have spares and hers was spastic). While I was looking for the charger, she says, "Why don't we go to norman and see my friends play a jazz set?" and of course I went. I always have some fantastic luck when I hang out with her; I met a former South African paratrooper at one party, or there was the time we came across fire-dancers just before a rock show, etc, etc. This time, one of the professors from OU showed up and asked to sit in, and dude was cool. Didn't hog the stage, played a couple good numbers, and left. And my five minutes were up a while ago: <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Trumpet playin' man.</span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><br />More later.

	  It seems like every weekend, we have and excuse to party... and if there is no party, we at least have a reason to drink. Anyway, I know these are like a week and a half late, but I really had far too much fun at this party and the day after... I've had a lot of good days in the past moth or so, and this was one of them (or at least that night and the next morning). The kind of good time that makes me want to hang onto certain pictures, even though they're not as good. When I rush to post, that's when you see 40 pictures split into two posts; when I wait, you get 7 pictures in one post, but I think they're the best 7. Anyway, on with the show: <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />
