	  <img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />So, i kind of wasn't going to blog this, it being old news and all, but I wanted to at least share the pictures. Funny story: for the pictures of everybody crouded together in the bathroom, that was for the second cell that passed over us, the one that wasn't really anything to worry about.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />My first day in the office was actually good. Doing sysadin-like duties already, although I don't really think I qualify for the title yet. Or at least I was doing them until the power went out. Point for twitter- I found out about the storm a little ahead of everyone else on twitter. Then I sat there for twenty minutes trying to find decent radar coverage (not really possible on the internet, unless you get a live feed from the tv stations, which is easier to get from, say, a TV).<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/02/10/a-weekend-in-kentucky.html">a weekend in kentucky</a></h2>
	  So I started my new job for reals last weekend, and it was strange, like everything else in my life. The traveling was some of the easiest I've done. Nothing went wrong (in an unfixable way, at least). Like I said, the things that are usually difficult, like morning coffee or lunch, were handled with ease. For those not in the know: my new job is taking pictures of dance competitions. to the tune of 20k images a weekend.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/louisville/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />The hard part wasn't really taking the photos, either, although I can tell already that my timing and camera handling is going to get a lot better (this coming from someone who didn't think that was possible). This is a good thing.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/louisville/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />(There was some bs here that I cut out, because some shit shouldn't see the light of day. not while it's half baked at least. suffice to say that dance competitions are hard to fit into my worldview; they are, in a word, problematic). <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/louisville/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />At the end of the day, the girls probably mostly have a great time dancing, and enjoy having quality pictures of what they love doing. I can dig on that. Thinking of it that way, it's hard to hold onto my objections. At the end of the day, I'm a professional. I do the job, nobody gets hurt because of it, maybe some people enjoy what I produce even. That's fine with me.
