	  Let's see, it's been a while since I rapped at ya'... like before last saturday, I think. I can count how much sleep I've had since then on my fingers and toes. 1+4+4+2+4=15 hours since noon friday. It's amazing how quickly it catches up with you. Stupid insomnia.<br /><br />So yeah, Denver was nice. I finally got the burrito I've been craving, from illegal pete's. Met this really cool gay nurse. I would have loved to talk to him a little more, because he knew a lot about medical things I'm curious about but never had anyone to ask. Like he knew a new thing for me to try for my insomnia, a protein called theanine.<br /><br />Yeah, then I got on a plane and came home, slept four hous and then drove an hour and a half to get to work. Work was easy and good and they're paying, which is so huge of a plus I'm going to be in the black eventually.<br /><br />Pictures:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>

	  Orphans: Brawlers, bawlers and bastards. It's a mix of amazing things that blow my mind and amazing things that creep up behind me and hit me over the head and totally unbelievable things that really can't be said but can only be heard. Really, if you're too poor to afford this album, go steal it. It's easy enough, and totally worth going to jail over. <br /><br />On the good news front, I've got everything I need for work on tuesday. Laundry is washing, to get me ready for a flight tomorrow. I'm going to Denver for some tests to get into a study. The upshot is I get free blood pressure meds, free monitoring of a kidney problem I've got, and a free plane ride every so often. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_kidney_disease">Polysystic Kidney Disease</a> (adpkd) is what I've got. In my family the onset is a little earlier than average. My aunt had renal failure at 48, my uncle in his early forties, my grandmother at 46 or so (I don't know exactly because she wasn't born yet). My mom, and this is the good news, is 51 and is six months to a year from going on dialysis (they usually start dialysis before total kidney failure, at 15-20%). <br /><br />I've known about this since I was about 16. I was having headaches, went to the doc, he diagnosed me with high blood pressure and because of my history ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis. So, I know that in about 27 years I'm going to get really stuck and tied-down (in dialysis) if not just plain dead. <br /><br />It's OK. I have a plan, and yes, I know how it ends, six feet under. It's what happens between now and then that makes a difference. I've just gotta burn hotter, faster, and better than the rest, that's all.<br /><br />Let's see, I've been emailing with Lora over the past few days. I was pissed, and I let her know about it. I've gotten over being pissed, and we're finally talking, which is an improvement. <br /><br />New  <a href="http://www.adorama.com/ICAS5.html">camera</a> hotness, just for my job. It'll do. Anyway, more pictures later, when I'm done looking at today's take.<br /><br />Tom Waits is now God, replacing Virginia Woolf.

	  so I can't sleep. stupid insomnia. The pure awesome in the title is all the good things that happened to me today. The hard drive issue was resolved, and now I have more storage on board my laptop. unfortunately, I don't have any music any more. <br /><br />Also in the good news column, Dillon called to give me a heads up that his boss would be calling to give me a job with his company. And then his boss called and I've got the job. Which means I won't be joining the apprenticeship after all, and I'll be making almost three times what I would have anyway.  I GOT A JOB DOING PHOTOGRAPHY! YAY! That alone is enough to make my day. But then....<br /><br />The I decided to go out and celebrate, and Dillon says, meet me at the blue note, and oh yeah, Joanna's in town. SoI try to go to the blue note, only I get lost, then I find a gas station with a phone book, then I go to the address and there is the bar. And the Voodoo Glow Skulls were playing! Yay! They rocked so hard and so loud the air got thick, the mosh pit was so intense I was dizzy just shooting pics of it. Anyway, these are my to selects, I'm going to go try to sleep now. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

	  and thereÅ› a good reason for that actually. My pecious MacbookÂ´s hard dive died. I maen, like,  really dead. Making bac clicking and hig pitched grinding noises, dead. So Im blogging from the handheld while a new install of mac osx is working. Luckily for me, I have a ton of hard drives sort of laying around. I spent about half of last night (when I was supposed to go out and have a beer) trying to download and install <a href=http://www.ubuntu.org>Ubuntu</a>, but for some reason the install disk didnÂ´t work in either my momÂ´Å› laptop or mine. Then, while I was trying to find a 6-pin to 4-pin firewire adapter, I found the restore disks for my current laptop, which Id assumed were gone forever. By then it was 3qam though, and so I went to sleep. Which explains why Im doing an install in the afternoon.<br /><br />Had My interview to be a plumber yesterday. It went pretty well, although I shouldnÂ´t have mentioned my photography, for some reason the guys doing the interview couldntÂ´understand how someone could be two things at once. The answer, of course, is very carefully if at all. <br /><br />WeÂ´Äºl see. I got 10th on the list and 8 have already been called, which means IÂ´m #2 on the list right now. I dont really want to go out as a plumbing apprentice. Seems boring. Welding on the other hand is the magic that holds the world together, quite literally. The interview for that is tomorrow. I know what not to say this time too.
