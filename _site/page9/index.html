	  <p>For some reason, I&#8217;m still a month behind, although I am slowly but surely catching up. Sarah, a couple days after thanksgiving, invited me to her family&#8217;s late-giving, which they&#8217;d delayed so she could make it. It was nice, and then the next day we went to friendsgiving, which I didn&#8217;t really take pictures of because I was too busy stuffing my face.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2010/12/27/my-house-is-clean-pictures-unrelated.html">My house is clean! (pictures unrelated)</a></h2>
	  <p>This is worth a blog post by itself&#8230; my house hasn&#8217;t been this clean since last spring at least&#8230; pretty sure I swept sometime last march&#8230; not really. But shit had gotten out of hand what with me having no time to clean and less energy than time. I scrubbed everywhere that needs to be scrubbed, swept what needed to be swept, and all my dishes are clean. funny story: my house stays cleaner when I&#8217;m broke. Although why I didn&#8217;t do this in the months between getting back from egypt and starting the new job I don&#8217;t know. anyway yeah, photos unrelated (from Athena and Aphrodite&#8217;s bday party):</p>

	  <p>This was the best live show I&#8217;ve ever seen. Freakin&#8217; amazing. Electric and intense and raw and the lead singer, Casey, was the center of it all. If you weren&#8217;t there you should be pissed. You missed a hell of a show.</p>

	  <p>Please wake me up in my dreams.&quot; Just rediscovering how awesome an album &#8220;Frank&#8217;s Wild Years&#8221; is. Seriously, you should give it a listen. Also &#8220;Romeo is Bleeding&#8221; off of Blue Valentine, very good. Merry Christmas, happy blah blah. Another post coming soon; this won&#8217;t satisfy my blogging addiction for today.</p>

	  <p>Well, one of them&#8230; there were several, actually, but this one is the only one I went to. And there are other good photos, mostly variations on these though. And Atlas (the baby, and isn&#8217;t that a awesome name?) was born the day before yesterday (or was it yesterday? I haven&#8217;t been able to keep track of the days in weeks). If the kid&#8217;s as rad as his parents, he&#8217;s set for a rad life.</p>
