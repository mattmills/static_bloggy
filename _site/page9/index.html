	  <h2><a href="/2010/12/30/a-moment.html">a moment</a></h2>
	  <p>Sometimes there&#8217;s a moment when I see something and I realize the world is changing; we say things are different now but it doesn&#8217;t really affect the mood in my head, but then I see something like this guy hanging down from the broadway extension to do god knows what maintenance, and something clicks. Hundreds of feet in the air like some kind of hero, just doing his job. Not &#8216;everyday hero&#8217; but &#8216;this wasn&#8217;t possible before&#8217;; something outside my personal mythos. And then for a while my thoughts are colored by the fact the the world is bigger and stranger than even I thought; and that&#8217;s saying something.</p>

	  <p>For some reason, I&#8217;m still a month behind, although I am slowly but surely catching up. Sarah, a couple days after thanksgiving, invited me to her family&#8217;s late-giving, which they&#8217;d delayed so she could make it. It was nice, and then the next day we went to friendsgiving, which I didn&#8217;t really take pictures of because I was too busy stuffing my face.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/2010/12/27/my-house-is-clean-pictures-unrelated.html">My house is clean! (pictures unrelated)</a></h2>
	  <p>This is worth a blog post by itself&#8230; my house hasn&#8217;t been this clean since last spring at least&#8230; pretty sure I swept sometime last march&#8230; not really. But shit had gotten out of hand what with me having no time to clean and less energy than time. I scrubbed everywhere that needs to be scrubbed, swept what needed to be swept, and all my dishes are clean. funny story: my house stays cleaner when I&#8217;m broke. Although why I didn&#8217;t do this in the months between getting back from egypt and starting the new job I don&#8217;t know. anyway yeah, photos unrelated (from Athena and Aphrodite&#8217;s bday party):</p>

	  <p>This was the best live show I&#8217;ve ever seen. Freakin&#8217; amazing. Electric and intense and raw and the lead singer, Casey, was the center of it all. If you weren&#8217;t there you should be pissed. You missed a hell of a show.</p>
