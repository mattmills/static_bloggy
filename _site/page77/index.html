	  <h2><a href="/2009/07/19/post-250.html">post #250!</a></h2>
	  Never though this blog would make it this long. But then I also thought I'd be long gone from oklahoma too. Anyway, It's been an interesting four days, to say the least. I got my new camera on wednesday, and I couldn't be happier with it. The D700 is an amazing machine; it makes everything that I do easier and pushes the realm of photographic possibility farther than I'd thought possible. Yeah, it's that good. <br /><br />That was my first delay; I was having too much fun with the new camera to blog. Then the power went out in my neighborhood overnight, and there was no internet; then, finally, just as I got these photos edited, i spilled a coffee into my macbook, ruining it. so now they're re-edited, and here for your enjoyment. <br /><br />Next post: look for the gratuitous cat photos (not what you think). <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0005.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0006.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>

	  <h2><a href="/2009/07/19/no-you-cant-tawe-my-picture.html">No, you can't tawe my picture</a></h2>
	  dear lookatokc photographer,<br /><br />No, you can't take my picture. Yes, I'm also a working photographer (for a given value of working), no, that doesn't mean we really have anything in common. You take party pics, i take pictures of my friends at parties. You use a flash when you don't need it, I hate it even when I absolutely have to use it. You have a huge camera bag weighing you down with shit you don't need, I only own two lenses. All of these are strikes against you, but really, it's just that I don't like having my picture taken. <br /><br />Some of us don't want to be in the paper. I might be the only one, but I'd wager there are at least a few people out there who like anonymity. Or who need it. <br /><br />Certainly there's little value in party pics, hell, I take thousands myself and put them on this shitty blog, but the big difference is that I know the people that I take pictures of, for the most part. I feel weird not knowing people and taking their picture. It's knowing the people that lets me get closer, get a little more meaning in the phototographs than the standard grin and grab-the-person-next-to-you. Some of them, at least (yes, there are a few posed pics here on the blog and more on my facebook, but those are here for the people in them, not for me to show off).<br /><br />

	  This band, Larry and his flask, is a crazy high energy bluegrass punk band. Good sound, but I didn't stay for the second set. I don't know, the blugrass part of their sound got annoying to me, but then I loved them for the first half. Go figure. <br /><br />The guy with the base, though, I swear he was playing tourette's or something, different instruments every song, running around, throwing his base on the floor and then on a table, just crazy. Entertaining as hell. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, new camera's here, I'm playing with and and enjoying the hell out of it. Laters.

	  another round of drinking and photos... this was one of those nights that sort of blurred together towards the end... really fun, though, and I woke up in time to head off the hangover with water. Protip: Water works best before you actually feel the hangover. If you already have a headache, you're going to suffer more. <br /><br />Anyway, I rode my bike to get down there, 20 miles in 2.3 hours... terrible time, I know, but I did it, and that's the important part. There was a lot of terror and panic, and anger at everything with four wheels, but it's all part of the show at this point. I've just got to recondition myself, and that's going to take time. How long before I can ride ten miles in half an hour again? I don't know, probably a while. How long before I don't flinch every time a car passes is more important, and hopefully that'll be sooner. Pain and fatigue I can deal with, fear is harder.<br /><br />Less seriously, though, the night was a blast. 2 hours of bike riding to get to 6 hours of party=8 good hours. For example:<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Fabulous shoes.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >B-Bell in classic black and white.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Birthday Girl Shelby. Peep that bling.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >An infinity of bromance? No, I actually think they were headbutting or something. I did mention that things were blurry for me at the end of the night, right?</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Traci and Casey, now roommates and rhyme-mates.</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Incidentally, this is the same guy (mario, I think) who had the shoes. Makes me wonder: Are they clown shoes?</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >Shelby and Cody, and the damn taco bell cup I was sorely tempted to clone out. </span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" >LOLWAT?</span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, I've got a bike to ride and pictures that won't take themselves.
