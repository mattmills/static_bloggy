	  And I'm not drawn in by their evil conspiracy. It's taken years, but now they're finally making a move. Wake up, Sheeple! <br /><br />(At least one person reading this will get the joke. The rest of you, don't worry, I'm not any more unhinged than I ever was).<br /><br />I'm writing this from my restored and much loved macbook. Friday night, before I went out to shoot these pictures, I was leaning over my desk to grab my bike off of the wall, and I knocked over a 16oz cup of coffee right into the computer. I knew there was nothing I could really do then; the best thing to do is let it dry first. So I did, I went off to the party, had a good time, (moar hellkats=more good times), and rode home. <br /><br />Next day, I tried to restart it, no dice, so I opened it up and there was a ton of gunk on everything, of course. Coffee+2.5yrs of dust, pretty much. Disheartened, I gave up and went to Mcnellies to be attacked by the photographer from lookatOKC. No, I don't want my picture taken. No, I won't sign a release. Go talk to the wedding party. It's my own fault for wearing my houndstooth fedora; that thing draws attention like whoa. <br /><br />Paperazzi deflected (yeah, I'm aware of the irony, but at least I know the people I take pictures of), I went home, and little elves hadn't come in and fixed my laptop, so the next day (sunday), I started dousing it with alcohol, and then I had the bright idea to get out a toothbrush and scrub away the crud. I let it dry overnight, plugged everything together, and it worked on the first try. Go me. <br /><br />also: the more I use my new camera, the more I love it. I've already shot 2000 photos with it. ok, fine, I'll shut up about it already. But the good news keeps on coming, I have a job interview tomorrow, I fixed this laptop, etc. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0011.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0012.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0013.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  Never though this blog would make it this long. But then I also thought I'd be long gone from oklahoma too. Anyway, It's been an interesting four days, to say the least. I got my new camera on wednesday, and I couldn't be happier with it. The D700 is an amazing machine; it makes everything that I do easier and pushes the realm of photographic possibility farther than I'd thought possible. Yeah, it's that good. <br /><br />That was my first delay; I was having too much fun with the new camera to blog. Then the power went out in my neighborhood overnight, and there was no internet; then, finally, just as I got these photos edited, i spilled a coffee into my macbook, ruining it. so now they're re-edited, and here for your enjoyment. <br /><br />Next post: look for the gratuitous cat photos (not what you think). <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0001.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0002.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0003.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0004.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0005.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0006.jpg" class="photo" alt="Photos"/>

	  <h2><a href="/2009/07/19/no-you-cant-tawe-my-picture.html">No, you can't tawe my picture</a></h2>
	  dear lookatokc photographer,<br /><br />No, you can't take my picture. Yes, I'm also a working photographer (for a given value of working), no, that doesn't mean we really have anything in common. You take party pics, i take pictures of my friends at parties. You use a flash when you don't need it, I hate it even when I absolutely have to use it. You have a huge camera bag weighing you down with shit you don't need, I only own two lenses. All of these are strikes against you, but really, it's just that I don't like having my picture taken. <br /><br />Some of us don't want to be in the paper. I might be the only one, but I'd wager there are at least a few people out there who like anonymity. Or who need it. <br /><br />Certainly there's little value in party pics, hell, I take thousands myself and put them on this shitty blog, but the big difference is that I know the people that I take pictures of, for the most part. I feel weird not knowing people and taking their picture. It's knowing the people that lets me get closer, get a little more meaning in the phototographs than the standard grin and grab-the-person-next-to-you. Some of them, at least (yes, there are a few posed pics here on the blog and more on my facebook, but those are here for the people in them, not for me to show off).<br /><br />

	  This band, Larry and his flask, is a crazy high energy bluegrass punk band. Good sound, but I didn't stay for the second set. I don't know, the blugrass part of their sound got annoying to me, but then I loved them for the first half. Go figure. <br /><br />The guy with the base, though, I swear he was playing tourette's or something, different instruments every song, running around, throwing his base on the floor and then on a table, just crazy. Entertaining as hell. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Anyway, new camera's here, I'm playing with and and enjoying the hell out of it. Laters.
