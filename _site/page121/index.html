	  not really. I just feel good because I'm drunk. oh, drunkblogging. and making up words.<br /><br />So I went out to the bar tonight to celebrate the <a href="http://www.gestaltnews.com">first issue</a> and I sit at the bar next to these two chicks, Melodi and Kat, all decked out prettylike and pretty soon we're talking and I'm like whoa hold on and I run out to the car to get my camera.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />So, I get back in and I'm like "Can I get a picture?" and they're like sure, no problem, so I get a couple snaps. Then I hit the head, and make the obligatory self portrait. hey, hanging around Alex nursed my nascent narcissism.  I'm an alliterative drunk. With a spell checker. <br /><br />Anyway, I come back out, realize I'm out of money, and I head home, right after I make another pic of the hotchicks and random dude. Then I got home, thought for a second, grabbed a pack of smokes, and went back, only to find the hotchicks had left. And if any of us hadn't been broke we'd all still be drinking. Last call is right about now in most places in this town. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Oh yeah, the reason I'm still drunk is there's this bottle of wine on my desk, you see. It was helping me do javascript last night and earlier today, and that didn't kill it, but I'm about to. I know that sounds like an alcoholic talking but really I don;t drink that much. It is fun when I do though. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />Also, I just found <a href="www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a> which is maybe the most amazing thing on the internet ever. I jumped up and down and scared my cat when I realized what it is. You get to catalogue your books and find people with the same stuff/interests. WOW. And the wine is gone and there are pics to edit for this post. Hope everyone is out there having as good a time as I've been having.

	  and that's not really a bad thing. <a href="http://www.getstaltnews.com/">Gestalt</a> is up and running with its beta issue. The gallery is some nifty javascript which needs just a little tweaking to be really wonderful. There are a lot of things I'd like to get fixed before the next issue, mostly more content. I don't really like the headline font now, although it seemed perfect three weeks ago when we picked it. Google ads aren't online yet. For anyone who'd like to contribute a story, just <a href="mailto:mail@gestaltnews.com">email me</a>. Ok, now I gotta get away from the computer. Later

	  I'm typing this up from the handheld, watching a movie. It's a little weird, but it'll do.<br /><br />I've been thinking about my photography, about how I tend to be blurry a lot. The thing is, I'm constantly trying to not be blurry. Fast lenses, fast ISO, steady hands. The problem is life is blurry sometiems, it moves very fast, is fleeting, never stops.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />There was a storm today, looked like it might produce a tornado right over my house. There I am in the miiddle of the road, takng pictures, mom yelling at me to come inside. So, after watching for another minute, I did. The truth is though that I would have stayed out there and watched the storm. There wasn't any real danger, just hailstones. The tornadoes all touched down a mile east of here, really small ones. We did get some pretty big hail though. and then another storm in the night.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />It's funny how things work out sometimes. I really wanted to write a post earlier today about how excellent and wonderful girls can be sometimes, even while they're exasperating, but the energy's all gon out of me. maybe later. but things are good, the house is still here, and I'm still talking to everyone. Gestalt is going to happen, even if we only have five pieces in our first issue.

	  I'm going to spend at least some of today outside in the sunshine. It's a good day for it. I spent all day yesterday sitting inside on my ass. I was reading, which is good, but I really wish I'd gotten out a little, so now, here I go. Before I head out, random picture:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog430-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog430-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
