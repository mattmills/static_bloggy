	  I'm typing this up from the handheld, watching a movie. It's a little weird, but it'll do.<br /><br />I've been thinking about my photography, about how I tend to be blurry a lot. The thing is, I'm constantly trying to not be blurry. Fast lenses, fast ISO, steady hands. The problem is life is blurry sometiems, it moves very fast, is fleeting, never stops.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />There was a storm today, looked like it might produce a tornado right over my house. There I am in the miiddle of the road, takng pictures, mom yelling at me to come inside. So, after watching for another minute, I did. The truth is though that I would have stayed out there and watched the storm. There wasn't any real danger, just hailstones. The tornadoes all touched down a mile east of here, really small ones. We did get some pretty big hail though. and then another storm in the night.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />It's funny how things work out sometimes. I really wanted to write a post earlier today about how excellent and wonderful girls can be sometimes, even while they're exasperating, but the energy's all gon out of me. maybe later. but things are good, the house is still here, and I'm still talking to everyone. Gestalt is going to happen, even if we only have five pieces in our first issue.

	  I'm going to spend at least some of today outside in the sunshine. It's a good day for it. I spent all day yesterday sitting inside on my ass. I was reading, which is good, but I really wish I'd gotten out a little, so now, here I go. Before I head out, random picture:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog430-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog430-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

	  t-bone steak and some cheap red wine. If my life were any more awesome, I'd have to get a license.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Friday was good in general, and specifically because I went beck to the arts fest, and then later on out with some new friends. Arts fest was cool; I was less of a chickenshit and shot more looking through the viewfinder. Then I called up Sabrina, asked what she was up to later, she was doing a bunch of stuff, but she would call me when things were happening.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-1.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />So, I went home, chilled, mom came home, I started to take a nap. Just as I was really falling asleep, the phone rang, 'Rina and some peeps were at Logan's roadhouse, and I should join them.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-3.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Ten minutes later, I'm there, and who's hanging out but Pixie, Chris, Sabrina, and cool dude who's name I can't remember. If he weren't cool, I'd just say dude. I remember he's celibate, by choice, and maybe one of the most thoughtful people I've ever met. All present were cool, and it turned interesting.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-4.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Pixie is this super boisterous wonderful hotchick who I'd met briefly before, but she was blacked out, so this was one of those sort of first meetings. She's tough, been to the wars. Supposed to teach me tantra, although she was drunk when she said that so I won't hold her to it. That, and I'm not sure about our respective situations re: other partners. It would be fun, just some good sex, but really, I'm waiting for Jess. (Edit: life is complicated but good).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-5.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />So, drinking ensued, and continued until about 1:30 (we had moved locations several times, and ended up at a pizza joint in the paseo). Stop for beer/gum, and then we went to Pixie's house, where there was some beer drinking and some tv, and then Sabrina and cool dude left, pixie fell asleep on the couch, so I downed my beer and said my goodnight. Hey, there's something to be said for being a gentleman, even now. <br /><br />MORE Pictures! The first one is Pixie, the second is this creepy wax sculpture. You can figure out the rest on your own time. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-6.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-7.jpg"><img  src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
