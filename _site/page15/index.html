	  <h2><a href="/2010/10/28/back-at-the-suite-bartlesville-pt-2.html">back at the suite (bartlesville pt. 2)</a></h2>
	  <p>So, when I went up there, I thought I was going to be sleeping on a couch. This is fine, I&#8217;ve done it many times before, and don&#8217;t really mind. Kyle had other ideas. He got me a suite in the Price Tower, which if you don&#8217;t know, is the only skyscraper designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (well, the only one that got built, at least). I don&#8217;t know how, I only know that he paid very little for it through some connection he had. Nice if you can get it, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>Anyway: the photos. I forgot to mention in that first post that KJ came up with me, to keep me company on the drive and to see all her B-ville friends that she hadn&#8217;t seen in six months. Everybody came and partied in the suite for a minute, and then around four a.m. I kicked &#8217;em out and went to sleep. Took some architecture shots in the morning, because it was a pretty cool room. Two story, 1.5 bath, kitchenette. Great angles and lines. Yeah, and then I got ambushed with a photoshoot. But first! Brunch!</p>

	  <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Photography is not a &#8216;difficult&#8217; medium. All photographs are, by definition, &#8216;easy&#8217; to make—you just push a button. The value of the medium lies in the photographer&#8217;s calling a moment in time to our attention—a moment we might otherwise have missed—and saying &#8216;this is important.&#8217; It takes something simple and fleeting and turns it into something emblematic.&#8221; &#8211; William Eggleston</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not that much of an Eggleston fan, but this is so true. The moment, the place, the perspective is the important part. I get a lot of people that say to me &#8220;nice camera&#8221; (which is true) but 99% of the goodness is from knowing what and when is important. I used to go to rather incredible (even to me, now) lengths to get the pictures I thought were important, and, by and large, I did. Then digital came along and made the technical part of it all much simpler. It looks great on the back of the camera. I guess people can&#8217;t see the years of sweat and blood and adventures and wild things that led to it. All the barely surviving (literally near death many times), the relentless pursuit of it, the late nights, the early mornings, and the hundreds of thousands of pictures I&#8217;ve taken that have honed my photographic skills to be what they are. &#8220;Nice camera.&#8221; Yeah.</p>
<p>There was a point to this, but I&#8217;ve forgotten. Have a nice day. There should be some photos soon.</p>

	  <p>Yeah, more from the same shoot. The first two we were going for some kind of oklahoma-y look, and the last was just to be creepy.</p>

	  <p>Christa needed photos for her real world audition or something, and I&#8217;d been looking to do some kind of shoot for a while, something that got me away from the usual available-darkeness-drunk-friends schtick. My brother (the real one in <span class="caps">ABQ</span>) had just sent me some new lights, stands and umbrellas-2 of each, in fact. So we got together and did this in about an hour in my living room.</p>
