	  FYI, she's staring at tanner trying to track stand and chug beers. Tanner was able to get three without a foot down, but that photo just looks like a dude chugging beer on a bike.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/coupleportraits/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Jim, all dressed up at the party.

	  Ended up at sauced friday, and didn't have time to post these yesterday. some people might say that makes me a bad blogger, but they need to get a life. The band is called, I think, The Double Clutchers. I could tell they were having fun, not a bad sound, but a lot of covers. I enjoyed it.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />This girl is not a member of the band. Rule of thumb: stripes = trouble. She's not wearing paisley, that's all I'm sayin'. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/13/pictures-until-i-was-too-drunk-to-focus.html">Pictures until I was too drunk to focus</a></h2>
	  By which I actually mean there are more photos, and some of them are in focus, but after the last one here (which we'll pretend was intentional), I was walking the fine line between blackout and just stupid, and so none of those photos are any good. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I'm actually not sure any of these are any good, but they're kind of fun, at least. That's the threshold these days for blog-worthy photos, if I think someone I know will get a laugh or like it or link or somesuch, then I'll put it up. Actually, there's a quality threshold as well, see paragraph 1 for example. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Wednesday was a pretty epic night, and actually it's a good thing, because my money's just about run out again. Time to find another jobby job. I did a pretty good job of embarrassing myself in front of girls I barely know, and some old friends in the mix too. It's strange, the way things run in circles sometimes. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I've never seen a look on Cyrus's face like the one below, but it's probably always there under the surface- a sort of laughing incredulity. Either that or it's drunkface and I'm reading too much into a picture.  <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Reagan always makes the best photo-faces. It's like she's screaming "I"M REAGAN" with her whole face. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />And here's the old friends I was talking about- Chase and Brian- I've known Brian since high school. He'll probably get pissed and send me more death threats, but that's a risk I'm willing to take to bring everyone quality photos. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I really like this pic, for some ineffable reason. I know, I know. Shoot me. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos"/>

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/13/openbeta2.html">Openbeta2</a></h2>
	  Last night was openbeta, and it was actually a really cool interesting event. I'm not just saying that, you know; a lot of talks and conferences bore the shit out of me, and I just leave in the middle of them. OK, so I stepped out for a smoke in the middle of one of the boring lightning talks, but other than that, it was good.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />This is Grant, giving his demo of Twircl, which still hasn't launched, but is by far the coolest thing I've seen one of my friends come up with since art school. Twircl is a direct group messaging app that runs on top of twitter, something that the system  needs.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />These are the wimgo girls, and, well, do I really need to say anything. Thanks for the pen, ladies.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Grant kills 'em with his presentation:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Voltron Presents: Why they're awesome. I need to find out if they have any staff photographer openings. Maybe they need a screwball wandering correspondent for their web side? Y/Y?<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />The view from OKCCoCo:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Afterparty:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There was a good reason for these faces, but I can't remember for the life of me why.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" />
