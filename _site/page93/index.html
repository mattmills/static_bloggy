	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/13/pictures-until-i-was-too-drunk-to-focus.html">Pictures until I was too drunk to focus</a></h2>
	  By which I actually mean there are more photos, and some of them are in focus, but after the last one here (which we'll pretend was intentional), I was walking the fine line between blackout and just stupid, and so none of those photos are any good. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I'm actually not sure any of these are any good, but they're kind of fun, at least. That's the threshold these days for blog-worthy photos, if I think someone I know will get a laugh or like it or link or somesuch, then I'll put it up. Actually, there's a quality threshold as well, see paragraph 1 for example. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Wednesday was a pretty epic night, and actually it's a good thing, because my money's just about run out again. Time to find another jobby job. I did a pretty good job of embarrassing myself in front of girls I barely know, and some old friends in the mix too. It's strange, the way things run in circles sometimes. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I've never seen a look on Cyrus's face like the one below, but it's probably always there under the surface- a sort of laughing incredulity. Either that or it's drunkface and I'm reading too much into a picture.  <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />Reagan always makes the best photo-faces. It's like she's screaming "I"M REAGAN" with her whole face. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />And here's the old friends I was talking about- Chase and Brian- I've known Brian since high school. He'll probably get pissed and send me more death threats, but that's a risk I'm willing to take to bring everyone quality photos. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos"/><br /><br />I really like this pic, for some ineffable reason. I know, I know. Shoot me. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos"/>

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/13/openbeta2.html">Openbeta2</a></h2>
	  Last night was openbeta, and it was actually a really cool interesting event. I'm not just saying that, you know; a lot of talks and conferences bore the shit out of me, and I just leave in the middle of them. OK, so I stepped out for a smoke in the middle of one of the boring lightning talks, but other than that, it was good.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />This is Grant, giving his demo of Twircl, which still hasn't launched, but is by far the coolest thing I've seen one of my friends come up with since art school. Twircl is a direct group messaging app that runs on top of twitter, something that the system  needs.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />These are the wimgo girls, and, well, do I really need to say anything. Thanks for the pen, ladies.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Grant kills 'em with his presentation:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Voltron Presents: Why they're awesome. I need to find out if they have any staff photographer openings. Maybe they need a screwball wandering correspondent for their web side? Y/Y?<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />The view from OKCCoCo:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Afterparty:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There was a good reason for these faces, but I can't remember for the life of me why.<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0010.jpg"  alt="Photos" />

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/09/film-is-too-much.html">Film is too much</a></h2>
	  Shooting in a bit of a different mode yesterday. With the digital camera. Decided film was too expensive. So sue me. I don't think the look suffers that much. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I like how even the McD's sign is screwed up. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0005.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0006.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0007.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Every time I talk about this project, people bring up the tower theatre; looking at the fron of it, I wonder if it wouldn't be easier to just build a new one in the vacant lot across the street. <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0008.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0009.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />The shooting yesterday wasn't as good, as fulfilling as is was the first couple outings; I thought, walking back, that I might just give up the project and move on. But it seems like I'm onto something; the dilapidation there is a symptom of the wider economic problems. I can't tell if it's getting worse or better. Also, I look at the pictures, see I'm doing good work, and can hardly stop myself.

	  <h2><a href="/2009/03/08/some-random-photos.html">Some random photos</a></h2>
	  There's a post about momentum coming, but to tide everyone over until I can get that together, here's some photos from earlier in the week. Francois, on wednesday: <br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0001.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Ray-guns, at McNellie's:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0002.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />Cody at blue note:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0003.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br />It was one of those nights where I was the drunk one. Not as drunk as some people, though, and that turned out to be a good thing. I told Sarah early on in the night that I'd make sure she got home alright. She did, and I crashed on her couch.  My good deed for the week done, I give you the morning after:<br /><img src="http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0004.jpg"  alt="Photos" /><br /><br />More in a few minutes, when I get the real momentum post together.
