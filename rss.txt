          <description>&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s the second batch&amp;#8230; these are mostly meghan&amp;#8217;s and some supporting cast shots&amp;#8230; big B and his friend (chris? I don&amp;#8217;t remember the name).&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This shit was a blast. seriously a lot of fun. As in, we&amp;#8217;re going to have to do it again. Thanks to (in no particular order): Amber (hair and makeup), Brian (lights/grip), KJ, and Meghan (models). Anyway, yeah. Photos. I&amp;#8217;m splitting this into two posts to ease the server load. Next one in a hot minute.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>weird dreams. weirder reality. </title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;well, I opened this tab yesterday, and the dream I was going to write about has pretty much evaporated from my memory. Oh well. The first photo is from elemental, at there new shop, the first morning they were open&amp;#8230; it was sort of beautiful how thin their operation was, and how well it worked. There was one woman with a square reader taking credit cards, and one barista making amazing espresso drinks. It&amp;#8217;s gottena bit better now, even&amp;#8230; I think they have heat in their building, and some more furniture. Really exciting to see a new business start up an do so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the rest of the photos are the usual fare, from a night out at blue note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

          <title>city...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the city, I was riding around the other day, and had another one of those moments, where I saw something that caught me. I took this photo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/january_10/0022.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something about the combination of being in a big space (the structures always have that effect on me; I realize how much sky there is up there) and all the activity of construction made the growth the city is experiencing real to me. Like before, it was politicians talking about it, people bitching about it never going to happen, and here we are. It could be nice. Let&amp;#8217;s make it nice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;the patio is still the best place in the city to get some air and a bite at the same time. it&amp;#8217;s going to be a regular stop for me as soon as they get real beer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>cemetery in the neighborhood</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;well, not my neighborhodd, but the one I was staying in&amp;#8230; I conceived a big typology type project while I was there. All the cemeteries of New Orleans. Of course, I&amp;#8217;d have to live there&amp;#8230; if the city doesn&amp;#8217;t sink before I get the chance to move there, that is. It&amp;#8217;d be a couple years. When I&amp;#8217;m looking to semi-retire or something. or when I get a wild hair and have to light out. Although, as my local friends advised me, it&amp;#8217;d be easier if I picked a subset to look at. I could spend a long time looking at these angels, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, this night was pretty freakin awesome. My first tattoo and a lot of fireworks and drinking champagne etc etc etc. Auspicious. Suspicious. Something like that. &lt;br /&gt;

          <title>down to the fishin' camp</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So we drove down to Cocodrie, which is the middle of nowhere, reaching out towards the gulf of mexico. Even the middle of nowhere has trash pickup these days. That&amp;#8217;s america for ya. The birds were nice, flying to roost somewhere at sunset, and the sunset was pretty awesome, too. Nice to get away from it all for a minute. Which was the point of the trip, come to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>more new orleans... </title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;between things, so a quick blog post&amp;#8230; charging my phone, actually. Toured the Abita brewery while I was in Louisiana&amp;#8230; that&amp;#8217;s the crowd in the first photo. That&amp;#8217;s Lane(y?) and Jeana sorta dancing at rock n&amp;#8217; bowl in the second&amp;#8230; and finishing off the night at some local bar in the third. I like that bars there don&amp;#8217;t close except when the bartender feels like it. It lets the night flow much more naturally. Speaking of bars, my phone is charged enough to get me through the night and I&amp;#8217;m off.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>video shoot for brother gruesome</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So this was a long stop motion video that I think they were going to set to music and have a video; and at then end they knocked it all down. This rings all sorts of bells for me as a critic and artist; it&amp;#8217;s collaborative, impermanent, made for reproduction&amp;#8230; things I like, more or less. But standing there, looking at it, most of it sucked; right as it was about to go somewhere interesting one or more of the parties involved would fuck it up. Come to think of it though, that&amp;#8217;ll probably look pretty good on video.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNR&lt;/span&gt; talking, I swear. Anyway, yeah, onward and upward.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>mcnellies party plus after</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty good time, even though they cut the party off at 1am. Went to this sketchy party and arrived just as the cops were leaving, said f this and headed to a friend&amp;#8217;s house to dance till we got tired of it. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>welp, so much for that lens...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I just spent the last hour putting the finishing touches on a repair that I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notuntitled.com/articles/2010/10/14/saga-of-the-lens/&quot;&gt;way back when&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, there&amp;#8217;s nothing physically wrong with the lens; I had it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/p/BDQJn/&quot;&gt;many pieces&lt;/a&gt;, far enough into the guts to find any physical defect, and there were none. So, I don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s wrong with the lens. It works fine in manual focus, and I&amp;#8217;m tempted to sell it on ebay as such. then again, having a backup 50 is never a bad idea. Photo evidence (sorry for the crappy phone pic):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up next: photos. seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>max's birthday</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a couple of the photos, too good not to share. Damn that was a long day&amp;#8230; brunch, little kids, mcnellie&amp;#8217;s xmas party, and then the after party. No wonder I&amp;#8217;m exhausted all the time. Seriously I&amp;#8217;ve gotta do something about that. Sleep more probably.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Ali's b-day brunch</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So yeah, this was also a couple weeks ago. I think it was the sunday after christmas. Pretty sure, in fact. Jen made pumpkin pancakes, which were awesome. Other things happened, pictured below. Bobby skating. Porch sitting. Big B lookin like the big G with the sunlight coming from behind him. Canon on his lap though, and we all know canons are the devil&amp;#8217;s camera. (this is another case of me either being funny or unintelligible. I don&amp;#8217;t care which).&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;so I know it&amp;#8217;s no longer the holiday season and whatever, but it&amp;#8217;s particularly gray and all doom and gloom today, so here: christmas lights to cheer you up.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>conservatory show ish</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to this show on a monday, sometime before christmas. The poor first guy had almost nobody there&amp;#8230; I think his mom was taking pictures at one point, while the rest of us were off in the bar area, waiting for Rico Muerte to play. He wasn&amp;#8217;t bad, except all of his songs were about his girlfriend. Then RM came on, solid rock, then some dudes from savannah with way too much gear but decent sound and then I left before it was over because some of us have to work at 8:30 in the morning. I&amp;#8217;m not happy about it, but that&amp;#8217;s the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>a moment</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there&amp;#8217;s a moment when I see something and I realize the world is changing; we say things are different now but it doesn&amp;#8217;t really affect the mood in my head, but then I see something like this guy hanging down from the broadway extension to do god knows what maintenance, and something clicks. Hundreds of feet in the air like some kind of hero, just doing his job. Not &amp;#8216;everyday hero&amp;#8217; but &amp;#8216;this wasn&amp;#8217;t possible before&amp;#8217;; something outside my personal mythos. And then for a while my thoughts are colored by the fact the the world is bigger and stranger than even I thought; and that&amp;#8217;s saying something.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>My house is clean! (pictures unrelated)</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is worth a blog post by itself&amp;#8230; my house hasn&amp;#8217;t been this clean since last spring at least&amp;#8230; pretty sure I swept sometime last march&amp;#8230; not really. But shit had gotten out of hand what with me having no time to clean and less energy than time. I scrubbed everywhere that needs to be scrubbed, swept what needed to be swept, and all my dishes are clean. funny story: my house stays cleaner when I&amp;#8217;m broke. Although why I didn&amp;#8217;t do this in the months between getting back from egypt and starting the new job I don&amp;#8217;t know. anyway yeah, photos unrelated (from Athena and Aphrodite&amp;#8217;s bday party):&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>thanksgiving-ish</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I&amp;#8217;m still a month behind, although I am slowly but surely catching up. Sarah, a couple days after thanksgiving, invited me to her family&amp;#8217;s late-giving, which they&amp;#8217;d delayed so she could make it. It was nice, and then the next day we went to friendsgiving, which I didn&amp;#8217;t really take pictures of because I was too busy stuffing my face.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Mimsies Reunion show at blue note</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the best live show I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen. Freakin&amp;#8217; amazing. Electric and intense and raw and the lead singer, Casey, was the center of it all. If you weren&amp;#8217;t there you should be pissed. You missed a hell of a show.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Holly's baby shower</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, one of them&amp;#8230; there were several, actually, but this one is the only one I went to. And there are other good photos, mostly variations on these though. And Atlas (the baby, and isn&amp;#8217;t that a awesome name?) was born the day before yesterday (or was it yesterday? I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to keep track of the days in weeks). If the kid&amp;#8217;s as rad as his parents, he&amp;#8217;s set for a rad life.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Please wake me up in my dreams.&amp;quot; Just rediscovering how awesome an album &amp;#8220;Frank&amp;#8217;s Wild Years&amp;#8221; is. Seriously, you should give it a listen. Also &amp;#8220;Romeo is Bleeding&amp;#8221; off of Blue Valentine, very good. Merry Christmas, happy blah blah.

          <description>&lt;p&gt;er, well, it seems that way. Katie wanted some pinup-like pictures, which I&amp;#8217;m not posting, and some more normal ones, which are below. This was a fun shoot. As for the babies, four (five? six? depending on how close of a friend we&amp;#8217;re talking about) friends of varying closeness have had kids in the last 6 months, and several more are expecting. None for me, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>last time at the hell house. forever.</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure someone else will move in and civilize the place now and it won&amp;#8217;t be the hell house any more. This was a good way to go out though, beating a couch into submission with an axe and then burning it in the back yard, and then the fire trucks show up&amp;#8230; yeah. I&amp;#8217;ll miss it a little. That night with the fire was a perfect end to it for me: the right mix of madness and fun and hilarity, and also danger of decapitation/third degree burns.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>can't think of a title</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think I&amp;#8217;m being funny when actually I&amp;#8217;m being unintelligible. The title of the last post is an example of that. anyway, yeah, tired, but making it through. Time off soon, and a nice little trip&amp;#8230; things are happening again. It&amp;#8217;s after the solstice and I&amp;#8217;m breaking out of my winter doldrums. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Eclipse (jumping at shadows)</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So I knew if I didn&amp;#8217;t get this up now it&amp;#8217;d be after new years before I got to it. I had to improvise a tripod out of duct tape and a light stand. If you click on it, you can see it even bigger. I might have to make some prints of this one&amp;#8230; have to get an ink cartridge first though. hrm. I had lots of clever things to say that I though of while I was outside shooting this but now they&amp;#8217;ve all left my head and I need rest. See you guys in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Rico Muerte at Conservatory</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;it just occurred to me what an odd name that was for a rock and roll venue&amp;#8230; rock has never really been about conserving anything&amp;#8230; and I&amp;#8217;m in love with ellipses. Anyway, before rico muerte, there was this &amp;#8220;dad metal&amp;#8221; band who&amp;#8217;s name I can&amp;#8217;t remember, but who was unintentionally hilarious, all but the dude in the moon boot, who earned mad cred just for showing un in that shit. And the graffiti out back really kinda blew my mind. Anyway, onward and upward&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;And therefore the statute of limitations on embarrassment has expired&amp;#8230; and anyway, since when do I care about being embarrassed? This was a good party. I met Christian there, and it&amp;#8217;s been a month and a half of good times, with more in store.&lt;/p&gt;

Still looking for perfection. Still taking those photos. Still makin&amp;#8217; your women wish they were my woman. Don&amp;#8217;t get jealous&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s just the photos. don&amp;#8217;t worry, there&amp;#8217;s more where this came from.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>just found this...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Just found this in my scratch buffer, and I don&amp;#8217;t remember where I got it from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how can man die better&lt;br /&gt;
    Than facing fearful odds,&lt;br /&gt;
    For the ashes of his fathers,&lt;br /&gt;
    And the temples of his gods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little googling gave back &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lays_of_Ancient_Rome/Horatius&quot;&gt;Lays of Ancient Rome, Horatius&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s one of those battle poems that always leaves me teary. Which is to say one of two*. The other being &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20070513072721/http://etext.virginia.edu/britpo/tennyson/TenChar.html&quot;&gt;Charge of the Light Brigade&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon to right of them,&lt;br /&gt;
    Cannon to left of them, &lt;br /&gt;
    Cannon in front of them&lt;br /&gt;
    Volley&amp;#8217;d &amp;amp; thunder&amp;#8217;d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal of the 19th century. Rock on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*update: I remembered another one right after I hit publish, Henry V, act 4 scene 3. Of course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;photos from the hilo. this is why i&amp;#8217;ll never be upper management, and also why I don&amp;#8217;t care about ever being upper anything. the new job is nice though; I&amp;#8217;m working with good people, and doing interesting things, or at least they&amp;#8217;re interesting to me, which is what matters. And I think I&amp;#8217;ve got scheduling posts sorted for this thing, so that&amp;#8217;s good too, look for about one a day.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>birthday party?</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;SO, I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure this was timmy&amp;#8217;s birthday or something&amp;#8230; there was a keg, I remember that, and the european exchange students (not pictured). Also, while cody didn&amp;#8217;t land the pictured trick, he got it on the next try. I just like this photo better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so I once again have a huge backlog of photos ready to blog about. I&amp;#8217;m wishing my blogging software had better scheduling capabilities. I might have to hack on that sometime soon. Or maybe see if there&amp;#8217;s an extension already written. That&amp;#8217;d be cool. Now I have to code all afternoon, finish up with the old job stuff before I have to start the new job stuff on monday. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JOB&lt;/span&gt;, Yay! Anyway, photos:&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The way home</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. Came home, and then the haloween madness started. Kj drove, which meant I got to sleep, wonderful road-weary sleep, and I woke up and there was a sunset and we were nearly there. I wonder if you know how fucking wonderful that is? A moment of calm and peace, after one set of mad adventures and before the next.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>band shoot, second half (bartlesville part 4)</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The last one is my favorite; something about these guys just indicates a degree of whimsy. Thanks to the old man for the use of his antiques and mirror, thanks to Heather for inviting me and introducing all of us, and thanks to Kyle for the sweet suite (didn&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d pass that pun up, did you?). There&amp;#8217;s one more b-ville post coming, the road home, which is always sweet, and you shouldn&amp;#8217;t miss, &amp;#8216;cause it&amp;#8217;s got more KJ in it. Probably tomorrow lunch or in the evening, depending on how the day goes.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>insomnia post (Bville part 3)</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here I am, trying to sleep, and I can&amp;#8217;t. so I figure I&amp;#8217;ll post something. These are from the shoot that sunday afternoon, with Kyle in Bartlesville. There were a lot of things that were wrong, unprepared-for, and generally hilarious about this shoot, but overall, I can&amp;#8217;t complain, the images look pretty good. This is broken into two posts, just to ease the server load.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>back at the suite (bartlesville pt. 2)</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, when I went up there, I thought I was going to be sleeping on a couch. This is fine, I&amp;#8217;ve done it many times before, and don&amp;#8217;t really mind. Kyle had other ideas. He got me a suite in the Price Tower, which if you don&amp;#8217;t know, is the only skyscraper designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (well, the only one that got built, at least). I don&amp;#8217;t know how, I only know that he paid very little for it through some connection he had. Nice if you can get it, that&amp;#8217;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway: the photos. I forgot to mention in that first post that KJ came up with me, to keep me company on the drive and to see all her B-ville friends that she hadn&amp;#8217;t seen in six months. Everybody came and partied in the suite for a minute, and then around four a.m. I kicked &amp;#8217;em out and went to sleep. Took some architecture shots in the morning, because it was a pretty cool room. Two story, 1.5 bath, kitchenette. Great angles and lines. Yeah, and then I got ambushed with a photoshoot. But first! Brunch!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Frank and Lola's (bartlesville part 1)</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to Bartlesville a couple weeks ago, saw the sights, did some things, got into stuff. My friends Heather and Kyle invited me up to see a show, Truckstop Honeymoon, and to shoot Kyle&amp;#8217;s two-man band, er&amp;#8230; not sure what their name is, I&amp;#8217;ll update this when I find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, these are from the frist part of the night I spent there, the time in the bar, the band (truckstop h), this rad little girl who couldn&amp;#8217;t stop hula-hooping, and Kyle and Heather are the sickeningly sweet couple in the last shot. The sweetly engaged-later-that-night couple. I don&amp;#8217;t know if they&amp;#8217;re officially announced to the world, but hey, now they are. Of course, I can&amp;#8217;t think of anyone who reads this who they wouldn&amp;#8217;t want knowing. (As a blogger, I still haven&amp;#8217;t gotten it through my head that people I don&amp;#8217;t know actually read this shit).&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>William Eggleston and the "nice camera" effect</title>
          <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Photography is not a &amp;#8216;difficult&amp;#8217; medium. All photographs are, by definition, &amp;#8216;easy&amp;#8217; to make—you just push a button. The value of the medium lies in the photographer&amp;#8217;s calling a moment in time to our attention—a moment we might otherwise have missed—and saying &amp;#8216;this is important.&amp;#8217; It takes something simple and fleeting and turns it into something emblematic.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; William Eggleston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not that much of an Eggleston fan, but this is so true. The moment, the place, the perspective is the important part. I get a lot of people that say to me &amp;#8220;nice camera&amp;#8221; (which is true) but 99% of the goodness is from knowing what and when is important. I used to go to rather incredible (even to me, now) lengths to get the pictures I thought were important, and, by and large, I did. Then digital came along and made the technical part of it all much simpler. It looks great on the back of the camera. I guess people can&amp;#8217;t see the years of sweat and blood and adventures and wild things that led to it. All the barely surviving (literally near death many times), the relentless pursuit of it, the late nights, the early mornings, and the hundreds of thousands of pictures I&amp;#8217;ve taken that have honed my photographic skills to be what they are. &amp;#8220;Nice camera.&amp;#8221; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a point to this, but I&amp;#8217;ve forgotten. Have a nice day. There should be some photos soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Real live photo shoot with @christaemay</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Christa needed photos for her real world audition or something, and I&amp;#8217;d been looking to do some kind of shoot for a while, something that got me away from the usual available-darkeness-drunk-friends schtick. My brother (the real one in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ABQ&lt;/span&gt;) had just sent me some new lights, stands and umbrellas-2 of each, in fact. So we got together and did this in about an hour in my living room.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Fire. Party. And some weird toy. </title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I promised fun and adventure and pretty ladies, and the last two or three weeks have been full of that. Also full of chest cold sickness, but I&amp;#8217;m 90-95% better now. I haven&amp;#8217;t been this sick from a cold in years and years. The only thing keeping me together has been orange juice and cold pills. The cold pills don&amp;#8217;t exactly seem to work, but they&amp;#8217;re not hurting that I can tell. Anyway, this party was before I got sick.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>saga of the lens</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, my 50mm (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/50mm-f14-afs.htm&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) broke the other night with little warning. middle of a shoot, and it stops focusing. My spare 50 was at home in pieces, and my other lenses were also at home. This is the reality of getting ambushed with shoots in the middle of a road trip. Welcome to my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thinking that someone had spilled beer on my lens, I (somewhat desperately) ran it under the faucet in the bathroom, and that seemed to restore some limited movement to it, so I went with it. Of course, that wasn&amp;#8217;t what the real problem was, and no water actually got in the lens because it&amp;#8217;s weather sealed. More on that in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the blue note tuesday night, and the lens had given up completely, and another rinse did nothing. Now, I&amp;#8217;d already sent this lens to nikon once for this same problem, I told them to clean it, and when it came back it seemed all right. But here it was again, and so I was having visions of buying a new lens that wouldn&amp;#8217;t have this recurring problem. Probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/5014af.htm&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. So, that decision made, I figured I had nothing to lose by taking the lens apart last night and seeing if I could at least figure out what was causing the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t as odd as it sounds. I&amp;#8217;m pretty adept at fixing things in a general way. Cars, bikes, appliances, laptops, whatever. They&amp;#8217;re machines, not magic boxes. So I got out my trusty phillips head and started unscrewing (protip: modern lenses usually disassemble from the flange). What I discovered, once I was inside, was, well, odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.skitch.com/20101014-kqd7x6qdr21aceeajgygpqgtek.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lens_inside_2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside of the lens was more like a laptop than any of the other lenses I&amp;#8217;ve worked on. That actually made it easier, thank god. Lenses are usually a bitch to work with, which is why I wait till I&amp;#8217;ve got nothing left to lose to try anything. Anyway, one of the layers in my lens, the one marked in the photo above, was off, like it&amp;#8217;d been knocked out of place. My suspicion is that it&amp;#8217;s just held in place by spring tension, and a combination of bad knocks and bad luck threw it off. But, more to the point, it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be loose like that. This is a top-line relatively new lens, supposedly professional grade. It certainly cost me enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now it&amp;#8217;s back together and mostly working&amp;#8230; the autofocus isn&amp;#8217;t, but I can at least manually focus, and that&amp;#8217;s enough for now. Maybe when I get that replacement lens I&amp;#8217;ll tear it down again and see if I can fix it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;COMING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SOON&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8230; Photos! Pretty Girls! Fun, Adventure, Really Wild Things!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>back on the air (for real this time)</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve been having some issues with the site, mostly due to my own idiocy, but I think they&amp;#8217;re resolved and anything that happens from now on will be filed under &amp;#8216;new issues&amp;#8217;. Note: When configuring nginx, just tell it to listen on port 80, leave off the &amp;#8216;default&amp;#8217; that most configurations seem to have. If you need ssl too, that&amp;#8217;s port 443. There.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are some pictures. I&amp;#8217;ve been down with some kind of chest cold/flu, but I&amp;#8217;m coming back slowly. Coughing and hacking all the way, and a sinus infection to boot, but I&amp;#8217;m not all run down the way I was there for a while. I think I must&amp;#8217;ve picked it up at the fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a weird admonishment. I don&amp;#8217;t know why, exactly, but telling people to take comfort in rituals, when that&amp;#8217;s most of what people do already, well, it freaked me out a little. It&amp;#8217;s like saying &amp;#8216;Be complacent, be normal&amp;#8217;. Odd.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>the fair at night</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The first pic isn&amp;#8217;t from the fair, but it&amp;#8217;s only fair to put it in, because she got me in. As in Mckenzie bought my ticket. The fair at night isn&amp;#8217;t much different than the fair during the day, except that the crackhead-looking carnies are actually on crack, and not just fiending. There&amp;#8217;s another post from my daytime runs at the fair coming up, too. As soon as I finish with those photos, that is&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this took a very long time, to cover the distance between these two photos. Not a lot to say, really. Gonna have to go back to make up for the three weeks I missed.&lt;/p&gt;

Egypt was cut short because of some illness requiring a brief hospitalization, after which I was right as rain, but which completely drained my funds, destroying the fine balance I had between making money and spending it. So I had to come back early. I also now owe my mother a fortune, even though she says I don&amp;#8217;t. there will be state fair pictures soon, and plans are hatching for more adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s wonderfully quiet here. I&amp;#8217;ve only been here an hour and I&amp;#8217;m already more relaxed. Got a meal, got my room, a shower, etc, etc. Internets is spotty and costly here. We&amp;#8217;ll see if they change the password on me or what. Might just be incommunicado for a few days. Put the &amp;#8220;get away&amp;#8221; in get away from it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meantime, bus rides are boring, except when there are pretty things to photograph out the windows. I can&amp;#8217;t complain. The Sinai is pretty rad looking. Erm&amp;#8230; yeah. not a lot to say. Photos! Yeah! Look:&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Nile sunset</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So today I did a bad thing. I had dinner at Pizza Hut. But! I timed it so I would be right by the Nile, so I could see the sunset over the world&amp;#8217;s longest river, and take some pictures. Here:&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Cairo: Life in the street</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;yeah, I know, more street pictures. I could do this all month, if I weren&amp;rsquo;t sick of Cairo. Really, really tired. noise. Cars. Crossing the road. No food in the day, because of Ramadan. A week at the beach is just what the doctor ordered. Yeah: &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Cairo in the morning</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Compared to andy other time of the day, the streets in Cairo are empty in the morning, about 6am. I say about because I&amp;#8217;m not entirely sure of when this was. There&amp;#8217;s been some confusion about daylight savings time. I&amp;#8217;ve spent today in front of the computer, except for the half hour walk I took this morning, in the quiet. Programming and thinking and playing games. Man I need to get outta this room. Maybe go walk around. Down to the Museum, even though it&amp;#8217;s closed.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>cairo traffic</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;seriously, the traffic here is something else. It&amp;#8217;s a big part of what I&amp;#8217;ll take away from here. I&amp;#8217;ll have dreams of the sound of horns and weaving through crowds of pedestrians. Also, crossing the street here is a bitch and a half. The cars in that first picture? Stopped. Then they move a few feet, then they stop again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cairo_traffic/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were a fruit-lover I&amp;#8217;d be set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cairo_traffic/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hipshot foot-traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up next, though, we have the antithesis of this: at 7AM, the streets are empty and the light is wonderful. I&amp;#8217;m getting ready to move on from Cairo though. I found out about a really nice beach in a place called Dahab, in the southern Sinai. Cheap Too. I think what I might do is go there for a week and then come back here for a couple days (however long it takes to get my flight arranged) and then head back to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OKC&lt;/span&gt;. That means I&amp;#8217;ll be back around the 20th. That&amp;#8217;s two weeks earlier than I thought I&amp;#8217;d be coming home, but I think I&amp;#8217;ll need that time to make money. Gotta eat, gotta pay rent, etc. Meantime: Gotta rock out. Laters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>The Great Pyramid of Giza</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;yesterday, I went to the pyramids, fulfilling my tourist quota for this entire trip, and maybe even for my eventual recovery trip to St. Louis (Stuart: I would kill half a dozen men for a pizza-pie from blackthorn. Just name names. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;THERE&lt;/span&gt; IS NO &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;REAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PIZZA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahem. Anyway, I went with the same kiwi I&amp;#8217;d met yesterday, good guy. Walked around in the heat of the morning (not nearly as bad as you&amp;#8217;d expect) and in total spent about $20 (100 Egyptian pounds). I&amp;#8217;d been told previously that it was rather more expensive to get into the site, so I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, I could have paid more to go into one of the pyramids, and more to go into the temple next to sphinx, and more again for a guide, souvenirs, and refreshments, but as I had my water, knew enough about the pyramids already, and the only souvenir I wanted was a bit of sand, I was satisfied just to go and see and look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About that: Don&amp;#8217;t be an asshole. I say this because I was tempted to be like Anthony Bourdain and skip the pyramids altogether. That would have been a mistake. They are, in a word, magnificent. Skyscrapers are cool, and much taller, and arguably superior in a lot of other ways, but man, these things are &lt;em&gt;impressive&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve tried to convey the scale in the pictures below, but it&amp;#8217;s hard. Scale like that doesn&amp;#8217;t fit easily into a frame (it&amp;#8217;s interesting to note how well the city-scale of things here seems to fit in my viewfinder though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about the location: The town ends abruptly at the pyramids, and on the other side, from the looks of it, there is only desert. Amazing how the city would have such sharp borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway yeah. I&amp;#8217;m going to shut up and show you the pictures. The photo of me is by Mr. Kim (not his last name, but whatever). Annoying tourists are annoying, with all the silly things they do.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>museum day</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to the Cairo Museum yesterday. I met this New Zealand fellow, Kim, and he was going, and so I went. Photos were against the rules in the museum though, so unfortunately you&amp;#8217;ll have to go yourself to see such wonders as the burial mask of king tut and 12.5 million tiny statues of every pharaoh ever. Today we&amp;#8217;re going to the world&amp;#8217;s oldest tourist trap, the pyramids. Should be a fun morning. Then I really need to get some programming done. Money is officially short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson Pollack once said: &amp;#8220;All I ever wanted to do was paint sunlight on the side of a house,&amp;#8221; or something to that effect. I know exactly what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>first impressions are going to have to wait</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think I can make generalizations about what I see here. All I&amp;#8217;ve got is my specific story, so I&amp;#8217;ll stick to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/egypt_2/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve kind been a shut in the last couple days; I&amp;#8217;ve gone out for food once and once for a walk. I think it&amp;#8217;s just exhaustion; most of the rest of my time has been spent on sleep. In the days leading up to  transit I was averaging 4 hours of sleep a night, and I got something like 3 hours in 30 getting here. So I&amp;#8217;ve been bone-weary and hurting. Feeling better now though, I got a real meal for the first time since Houston, and that helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/egypt_2/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I said I wouldn&amp;#8217;t make any generalizations, but here&amp;#8217;s one: This city is gorgeous. Not in a pure clean way, but in a lovely organic way. And the sheer scale of it keeps taking me by surprise. There are lots of small spaces created by twisty alleys and the like, but then you take a turn onto a throughfare and there are panoramas like that first photo. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of dirt on everything here; it never rains to wash buildings away, and nobody has though of pressure washing, thank god, so buildings here are covered in dust and dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/egypt_2/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Aside: The 5AM call to prayer just rang out.) Earlier today, I was upstairs getting some tea (which felt great on my sore throat) and over loudspeakers from a nearby masque, a dude was leading prayers. And in what sounded like the middle of a sentence, he would just break into song for a measure or two, and then go back to talking. Completely acapella and spontaneous. He wasn&amp;#8217;t much of a singer, but there was something beautiful about it, anyway. I was told once, by one of my professors in college, that the words of the Koran were so beautiful that there were often on the spot converts on hearing them. Which leads me to believe that that&amp;#8217;s what the singing was. I could be wrong, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/egypt_2/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went for a walk, just to get around and see the neighborhood a little bit. The architecture here is an odd mishmash of time periods when the country was flush and rubble. Seriously, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of rubble from buildings torn down or fallen down. And again, there&amp;#8217;s the scale of the place; it&amp;#8217;s something I wasn&amp;#8217;t struck by in any of the other big cities I&amp;#8217;ve been to, but here the whole city is telling you it&amp;#8217;s a big place. Tons of history. Lots of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/egypt_2/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of little struggles that fill up the day of someone like me, traveling in a country where I don&amp;#8217;t speak the language. Getting food, for example. I have to just kind of point and hope for the best. Tea is easy; coffee also, plenty of that here. My money is holding up pretty well, although that may change as I eat more meals in the coming days. I think tomorrow may be a coding day; that way I can not have to worry about money so much. Although today was a coding day of sorts; I managed to get OAuth working for twitter on my blog, so the updates go to twitter and facebook again. Go me.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>the adventure of getting to the hostel</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, after the last plane landed, I got myself through customs with no hitches. The visa was a piece of cake, just pay the man, get your sticker, and move on. I looked like what I am, a tourist/backpacker, and customs doesn&amp;#8217;t give a fuck about guys like me. This is probably wise on their part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m sort of wandering around, and a taxi driver approaches me, wants £80 to drive me into the city. I&amp;#8217;m like, no way, there&amp;#8217;s a bus that&amp;#8217;ll get me there for way less. He tries to tell me there is no bus from the airport, yada yada, but I get on a shuttle and get to the airport bus terminal just fine. At this point I&amp;#8217;m feeling quite good about myself and take some notes to the effect of &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re not an idiot.&amp;#8221; And then I waited an hour for a bus that I never saw, and shared a cab into the city with some other backpackers. I tried to get the cabbie to take me to an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt;, as my funds were low, but he didn&amp;#8217;t understand. This is a recurring theme: English is useless here. Or nearly. So he dropped us off at the Cairo Museum, which was closed (probably for ramadan), and the other backpackers covered me. We wandered a bit in search of an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt;, no luck, so said our goodbyes and split off our separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus began one of the great trudges of my life, in search of my hostel. I walked one way, and then another, and then a third. Then I ran into some British people with a guidebook, who told me how to get to Ramses Square, which is very close to where I&amp;#8217;m staying, and so I set off walking. Unfortunately, what they said would be a 20 minute walk took the better part of 2 hours. There&amp;#8217;s nothing quite like the self doubt you get when walking alone with a heavy pack in a foreign city, with no map and only a vague idea of where you&amp;#8217;re going. So, I finally get to the square, and I can&amp;#8217;t for the life of me find the street I&amp;#8217;m supposed to go down to get to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I call my mom, shout some (this is the loudest city in the world), mom gets on google to try and help. I&amp;#8217;m trying to figure out where I am, exactly, because I&amp;#8217;m not sure after all the walking and the self doubt. So I walk down one road for a little while, find a hotel with a sign in english, and she does directions from there to my hostel, and kinda directs me. I&amp;#8217;m on the phone with her, and she&amp;#8217;s talking me through getting there, when this guy comes up to me and asks me in english, &amp;#8220;Can I help you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I show him the address of the hostel, and he knows the way, and we start walking. I never for a moment doubted this man; I could tell he wasn&amp;#8217;t a con man or tout. Just a man, doing something good. Along the way, he shows me a blob on his hand that at one time was a cross. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m christian,&amp;#8221; he tells me. &amp;#8220;Coptic?&amp;#8221; I ask. &amp;#8220;Yes,&amp;#8221; he said. And then I get up to the hostel, and there was showering and sleeping, and then wandering in search of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next: first impressions of Cairo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;ok, 15 minutes to dash off my thoughts so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tripout_egypt/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heathrow is a fucking orwellian labyrinth, complete with lots of fences and bored gaurds and weirdness so that it&amp;#8217;s right in the uncanny valley. The kind of shit that freaks you out a little after 18-24 hours of no sleep and flying. Seriously, I was turned the fuck around just figuring out which terminal I was supposed to get to. You had to go down a long hallway, don stairs, around several bends, onto a bus, up two floors, down another hallway, descend one floor, go through security again, and then you&amp;#8217;re there. But the departures board there doesn&amp;#8217;t show a gate until right before time to board. So you have to wait in this packed shopping mall area (high end stuff, sure, but do I really need a Luis Vuitton or a Rolex while in the middle of an airport?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tripout_egypt/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About that: Flying kinda sucks. It should be the miracle of flight, wow, soaring, but instead we&amp;#8217;re packed like sardines inside a stuffy, hot tin can. This might have something to do with the broken back last year making sitting for 8+ hours pretty uncomfortable (bordering on painful). I almost lost my watch and flashlight on the flight between Houston and london too. Actually, first I lost the cloth I put in my laptop to keep keyboard marks off the screen, and then I liost my watch reaching for it, and then I lost the flashlight looking for the watch. And a packet of cookies. I spent 2/3rds of the flight watchless and flashlightless, a little nervous that they were gone for good. And My knees were aching, I had a sinus headache from sonome&amp;#8217;s perfume, and my back was acting up for the first time in months and months. In other words, a pretty typical trans-atlantic flight. edit to add: I&amp;#8217;m drafting this again on my last flight, and this one I got a row all to myself. Instant Karma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tripout_egypt/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? I&amp;#8217;m smelly, sweaty, and very tired. edit: now just smelly and tired. This flight is much cooler, and I got a reasonable nap in. Now all I have to do is clear customs, hop a city bus to the main train station, and walk five minutes. Then I can rest. After I post this though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;update to the edits: took me four hours to get to my hostel, walking a lot, being lost, etc, etc. That&amp;#8217;ll get written up later though. sleep now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>addendum to the list</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, after compiling the list the other day, I realized there were a few things I left off, and some details I left out. First of all, the towel. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day#Origin&quot;&gt;A Towel is very important&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, I would take a backpacker&amp;#8217;s towel, which are made out of this microfiber super absorbent material, is smaller than a regular towel, and dries faster. For this trip, I&amp;#8217;m using a shamwow, which is the same material as the more expensive backpacker&amp;#8217;s towels, but cheaper and available everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laptop: it kills me to say this, but packing light isn&amp;#8217;t everything. I&amp;#8217;m taking the big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not pictured, but packed: A water filter, which was strongly recommended to me. We&amp;#8217;ll see if I really need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And two more things, especially for travel anywhere with mosquitos: A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sawyerproducts.com/B6B.htm&quot;&gt;sawyer extractor&lt;/a&gt;, and a bottle of 100% &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DEET&lt;/span&gt;. The extractor is for use on any kind of bug bite, sting, or even snake bite. The do wonders for itching bites, anyway. The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DEET&lt;/span&gt; is to keep from getting bitten when I&amp;#8217;m in an area with a lot of bugs. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what it all looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>and then the blue note</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;#8217;s 6am, and I&amp;#8217;m awake, I might as well blog these pictures. I lied, there&amp;#8217;s one more post of drunk people, at Che&amp;#8217;s birthday party. But they&amp;#8217;re very well done drunk people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grammatical aside: does it annoy the hell out of anyone else when someone refers a blog post as just a &amp;#8216;blog&amp;#8217;? Blog isn&amp;#8217;t just a post, it&amp;#8217;s the collective noun for all those posts. Get it right, people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because I&amp;#8217;m really bad about leaving tabs open and not hitting publish, it&amp;#8217;s no longer 6am. At least my left arm is working right again. It was all weak earlier because someone slept on it wrong. Not sayin&amp;#8217; who, that&amp;#8217;d be ungentlemanly.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>first, the Hilo</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, what would life be without the Hilo, with its drag shows, strong drinks, and occasional free darts? More dignified? Less blurry? Who knows. I&amp;#8217;ve definitely had some memorable nights there, and some nights I&amp;#8217;d rather forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bloggery aside: I&amp;#8217;ve got this post, one more about the blue note, and then it&amp;#8217;s all travel blogging for the next five weeks. Fun and adventure and really wild things. Also very few drunk people. Muslim country and all.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>at the pool</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the same Sunday, that same afternoon. Nice light, a lot of good action with people jumping into the pool. Also, high fives are always appropriate, even in mid air over the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>just a few</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Something to start your day off right with. If you&amp;#8217;re not supposed to have a beer at least you can have a photo. On the good news list: I found what might end up being my lightroom replacement in ubuntu. it&amp;#8217;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rawtherapee.com/&quot;&gt;raw therapee&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s pretty bare bones right now, but it does what I need for the road.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Star Gazing</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;You wouldn&amp;#8217;t think there would be photos from an adventure out to lake Arcadia to see the Perseid meteor shower, but then you aren&amp;#8217;t me. It all started at Heather&amp;#8217;s going away party. There were a few drinks (though not a lot, not by a damn sight) and somebody mentioned it, and then the next thing you know five of us were cramming into Heather&amp;#8217;s car (after dumping some of her jut-packed things into the back yard) and pushing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/before_egypt1/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/before_egypt1/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments after I took that, I had this impulse to stick my head out the window, to try to get a clearer picture of the road. Of course my hat was instantly blown off, so we had to go back and get it. Heather found it. Holly found a frisbee. Then we got back on the road, and got there without too many problems (although I was the only person who had a flashlight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/before_egypt1/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/before_egypt1/0021.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The meteors, it seemed, hadn&amp;#8217;t gotten the memo. Only a few of them came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/before_egypt1/0022.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn&amp;#8217;t matter though. We all saw a few, although we didn&amp;#8217;t all see the same ones. There were wonderful moments whenever a couple of us would see the same one and say &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s one!&amp;#8221; at the same time. Also, not pictured: the four moons of Jupiter that we could see through Holly&amp;#8217;s binoculars. Finally, I have to brag a little: that picture, the one below? Taken with only starlight. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BOO&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;YAH&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>sunday funday</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a couple sundays ago. Man was I tired. Actually, these might have been on two different days, but at least they feel like the same day. The way the days have been run together the last couple of weeks, I&amp;#8217;m not even sure which way is up sometimes. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just that I&amp;#8217;m really tired right now, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t had the air conditioner on in my house since the weather first cooled off on tuesday. Why waste money? It&amp;#8217;s so nice outside I&amp;#8217;m just letting that good air in. The smell reminds me of the mountains, the air around santa fe. Strong memories, good times. Here and now, the only way to be.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>a lot of cigarettes</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;(mom: ignore this) A little known secret about me: I only smoke because I like the way that smoke looks in the air. Which is also why I just barely smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>sometimes...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;sometimes you get lucky and the gods smile down on you when you walk out the front door and there&amp;#8217;s a beautiful sunset with the weirdest light that makes the air feel thick, like you could cut it with a knife. And then you go on to a rad evening that ends in the weirdest way possible, babies and nazis and flat tires, oh my. Just sayin&amp;#8217;:&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>the list</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m getting ready to go on a big ol&amp;#8217; trip to Egypt, as most of my friends know. And, well, I have a confession to make: I love lists. They&amp;#8217;re the only kind of organization I really ever use or need. My lists, they take care of me. Shot lists and set lists and tasks that need to be done. There is one kind of list that is nearer and dearer to me than any other though: The Packing List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I encountered one was in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/span&gt;, where the author said that any travelogue should have such a list laying around, and went through his list of things to take on your next motorcycle trip through the Dakotas. Later, when I was in college, I ended up doing quite a lot of traveling, and did a little research before each trip (especially one magical year where I was more out of the country than in). There are several good sites out there, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onebag.com&quot;&gt;onebag.com&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ease.com/~randyj/rjfootls.htm&quot;&gt;Backpack Travel Guide&lt;/a&gt; being the ones that come to mind immediately. These three share in that they&amp;#8217;re not just a list, but an annotated and in some cases footnoted list, filled with reasons and thoughts on why these things are important. This is my humble addition to that list of lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothes: This is pretty obvious, but it bears retelling: Two sets of clothing (plus on set of spare underwear) is plenty. You can mix and match and be appropriate for almost any occasion, and any more is really just added weight. This includes what I&amp;#8217;m wearing when I leave. &lt;br /&gt;
2 pairs pants- Loose dickies, cotton, but not denim. The same things I wear at home, for the same reasons. They blend in easily, dry fast and are double tough. &lt;br /&gt;
2 T-Shirts &amp;#8211; Black and gray, or black and blue. &lt;br /&gt;
3 boxers &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m a boxers man, now you know. &lt;br /&gt;
3 pairs socks &amp;#8211; Black, smartwool if you can afford it, but I stick to cotton cause I chew through socks too fast anyway. &lt;br /&gt;
3 A shirts (wife beaters, for those at home)- I always wear these. Dunno why, but even in the tropics I feel odd without an undershirt. &lt;br /&gt;
Sandals- As much for the shower/tub/pool as anything else. &lt;br /&gt;
Shoes- One pair of some kind of fairly resilient walking shoes. You abuse the hell out of your feet on the road, so these will be your best friend. &lt;br /&gt;
Rain Jacket- Something to block the wind and keep the wet off of you. &lt;br /&gt;
Cardigan/hoodie/sweater- An extra layer, to be added when you need it. Most places, it drops at least twenty degrees at night. Unless it was 90+, you&amp;#8217;ll need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipment:&lt;br /&gt;
Laptop- This trip I&amp;#8217;m kind of in a shambles about what laptop to take. All of the software I use is on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OSX&lt;/span&gt;, but my macbook is a 17&amp;quot;, not exactly minimalist. A netbook hackintosh would be ideal, but my netbook won&amp;#8217;t do that unfortunately. &lt;br /&gt;
Chargers- For everything that takes batteries. The camera, the laptop, the ipod, yada, yada. &lt;br /&gt;
Camera- I never go anywhere without it, and this is no exception. &lt;br /&gt;
Lenses- I tend to go a little overboard with the lenses. I take four. A 500mm mirror lens, a 35mm wide angle, a 50mm that I shoot 95% of my work with, and a 105 that is really lovely for portraits. &lt;br /&gt;
Ipod- might not go this time, as my iphone took a swim last weekend, and I&amp;#8217;m saving all my money for road expenses. &lt;br /&gt;
Headphones- Small ones, in-ear. They&amp;#8217;re nice for trains and buses and such, but I don&amp;#8217;t use them anywhere where isolation could be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
Hard Drives, power &amp;#8211; For photos. I generate a massive ammount of photos, and I put them on pocket hard drives, one in each bag. &lt;br /&gt;
Card Reader- For copying photos. Faster than plugging in the camera to the computer. &lt;br /&gt;
Blower- A gadget I use to keep my camera clean. Looks like a rocket ship. &lt;br /&gt;
Flashlight &amp;#8211; Tiny &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; or halogen, I have a couple. &lt;br /&gt;
Batteries &amp;#8211; spares for what I carry, namely my camera and the flashlight. &lt;br /&gt;
Three way plug adapter (2) &amp;#8211; An ingenious device that makes three outlets from one. Much smaller than a surge protector. &lt;br /&gt;
Phone &amp;#8211; Something cheap. Leave the iPhone at home, it&amp;#8217;ll just draw attention in a bad way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toiletries: I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have to explain these. &lt;br /&gt;
Soap&lt;br /&gt;
Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;
Towel&lt;br /&gt;
Q tips&lt;br /&gt;
Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;
Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;
Puff&lt;br /&gt;
Razor&lt;br /&gt;
Deodorant&lt;br /&gt;
Nail Clippers&lt;br /&gt;
Brush&lt;br /&gt;
Glasses&lt;br /&gt;
Saline&lt;br /&gt;
Contact Case&lt;br /&gt;
TP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miscellaneous:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Cards: for that extra touch of legitimacy. &lt;br /&gt;
Cup, bowl, spoon, fork: It&amp;#8217;s much cheaper and usually healthier to make your own meals when possible. I don&amp;#8217;t bother with a full backpacker&amp;#8217;s kitchen, as I tend to stick to cities, but these come in handy. &lt;br /&gt;
Sewing kit: Big needles, heavy thread. I end up loaning this out more than I need it myself, but it weighs nothing and takes up little space. Also, if you&amp;#8217;re badly cut and far from a hospital, this can save your ass.&lt;br /&gt;
Clothesline, laundry powder: For when you have to wash your clothes in a sink or basin. This is a daily chore, takes about fifteen minutes. &lt;br /&gt;
First Aid: Band-aids. Sterile wipes. Aspirin and Immodium. Anything worse, get to a doctor. &lt;br /&gt;
Multi-tool: Swiss Army or Leatherman or the like. &lt;br /&gt;
Eyeglass screwdriver: Just in case. In the field repairs are tricky at best. &lt;br /&gt;
Pocket Dictionary for the Destination country&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s about it. All of this goes into two bags: a camera bag and a carryon sized backpack. This kit can go anywhere in the world, with a few adjustments for climate in the clothes (more layers if you&amp;#8217;re not going somewhere equatorial), for an indefinite period. Clothes do tend to wear out faster on this schedule; I spent six weeks in mexico with almost this exact setup, and had to trash my shirts and socks at the end of it. I took a much bigger rig to Brazil for my semester abroad and regretted the weight and needed almost none of the extra things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>OpenBeta BarCamp Dos</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to this three(four?) weeks ago, and it was actually a pretty good time. The talks were a little on the basic side, I think because a lot of the heavy hitters in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OKC&lt;/span&gt; tech scene were absent (I&amp;#8217;m looking at you, Grant). I gave three talks, and in one, it turned out my audience knew more about the subject than I did, so I got to learn some things.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#8217;m way behind, so sue me. I don&amp;#8217;t know, I&amp;#8217;ve been kinda depressed. Luckily, I seem to be doing better right now. It&amp;#8217;s 4:15 in the morning and I feel fine.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Roller Derby</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The same day as barcamp (man, I was tired when I started that day, and near dead by the end), I went to my first banked-track roller derby match, between the Red Dirt Rebellion, and some team from florida. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RDR&lt;/span&gt; lost, but it was fun to watch and take photos of, anyway. The long lens shots were with my trusty 500mm mirror lens. Manually focused pictures of fast movement at slow shutter speeds. That&amp;#8217;s why I make the big bucks (somebody hire me please?).&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>warren ellis is batshit</title>
          <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=10222&quot;&gt;Warren Ellis&lt;/a&gt; is the craziest most obscene dude on the internet (at least, of the people that aren't dysfunctional lunatics): 

&lt;blockquote&gt;... It should really be a sort of Paul Schraderesque “well, we did a pile of cocaine the size of Sally Field, and then it turned out it was actually just Sally Field covered in cocaine, so we all did her, even Robert Towne’s dog, and then we ramraided a store and stole twelve typewriters, and then Peter Boyle beat us all unconscious and shoved peyote down our throats, and when we came to he was gone and there was just the typewriters and a loaded gun, so we menaced all the typewriters with the gun until one of them shat out the script we wanted, and somehow three weeks had gone by, and John Milius came by with a surfboard and a harpoon gun and said ‘let’s find us an artist’ and…”&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

          <title>love and the internet</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Love, man, that&amp;#8217;s a tough one. It doesn&amp;#8217;t make any sense. &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/55/&quot;&gt;My normal approach is useless here&lt;/a&gt;. Not that I&amp;#8217;d try to do math on it, but it&amp;#8217;s definitely one of those areas where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/what-i-learned-in-college-the-world-doesnt-make-any-sense/4153727?productTrackingContext=search_results/search_shelf/center/1&quot;&gt;the world doesn&amp;#8217;t make any sense&lt;/a&gt;. Is is bad that all of my thoughts can be summed up in links? the best, though, is the blockquote &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.tonypierce.com/2010/08/lost-bet-and-had-to-watch-bachelorette.html&quot;&gt;from tony pierce&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;but when it comes to love, real love, long lasting forever and ever love, the type of love that means everything, and fuels everything, and creates magic that last for generations &amp;#8211; well that love is worth climbing every mountain and fording through every stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that love is worth putting your perspective partner through every test and exercise, and more importantly yourself through tough questions and tougher actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which sometimes means you&amp;#8217;ll be alone for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;miles davis was known for his amazing music&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but i will submit that it was the silence in between the notes that made him legendary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as depeche mode once suggested&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enjoy the silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and pray for those who sleep on couches, those who propose on tv, and especially those who struggle with change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes: I&amp;#8217;ve decided, with the help of my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/thedauthi&quot;&gt;@thedauthi&lt;/a&gt; on twitter that there is an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;XKCD&lt;/span&gt; for anything nerd related. Also, that book was something I did my sophomore year in college, and you shouldn&amp;#8217;t buy it. Buy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/909837&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; instead. And always listen to the Blogfather about love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>When I took this I was thinking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planetperplex.com/img/magritte_empire_of_light.jpg&quot;&gt;Empire of Lights&lt;/a&gt;, but it's a little darker than that. This is the last photo I took before I had to send my camera off for cleaning. Anyway, yeah.

          <title>ghosts</title>
          <description>from &lt;a href=&quot;http://snarkmarket.com&quot;&gt;snarkmarket&lt;/a&gt;: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson likes to point out how it’s a mathematical cer­tainty that the air we breathe and the water we drink passed through the lungs and kidneys (respectively) of every one who ever lived. Like­wise, in these Civil War photos, both the destroyed Southern build­ings (one of them a US army fort) and the Northern cannons that destroyed them result from the profits of American slavery. Amer i­cans like to think about victories in World War II with out thinking about the cities and people destroyed in Russia and dozens of other countries (including Japan, Italy, and Germany) that stand behind that war — in no small part because we don’t have to live with them, to walk down those streets, to feel those ghosts. But we’re haunted all the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I just had to repost that- I love the idea of the past as ghosts, haunting us, unescapable. Shades of Robert Pirsig- we're the sum of all the ghosts of the past. Not all of them are bad, luckily. </description>

          <title>This is the new blog. </title>
          <description>It's remarkably like the old blog, except that it's all on my own server, and much less prone to downtime than tumblr was. Also, I managed to import all the old posts from the &quot;five years&quot; blog I had on blogger. So that's good too, even though I don't have the history in place yet. It'll happen. </description>

The piers are pummelled by the waves;&lt;br /&gt;

Lashes an abandoned train;&lt;br /&gt;
Outlaws fill the mountain caves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantastic grow the evening gowns;&lt;br /&gt;
Agents of the Fisc pursue&lt;br /&gt;
Absconding tax-defaulters through&lt;br /&gt;
The sewers of provincial towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private rites of magic send&lt;br /&gt;
The temple prostitutes to sleep;&lt;br /&gt;
All the literati keep&lt;br /&gt;
An imaginary friend.&lt;/p&gt;

Herds of reindeer move across&lt;br /&gt;
Miles and miles of golden moss,&lt;br /&gt;

          <title>about shooting film</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So these are the last images from that night of the blues saloon, the night of the party, only a couple nights before I would decide it was time for a detox. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It&amp;#8217;s funny, but my camera has been away at the service facility in El Segundo, CA, and I&amp;#8217;ve been using a film camera to get my fix. The shooting is very different. A lot of people will talk about the different qualities of the images, the grain structure, all of that, but something I really like is how few pictures there are on a roll. You get to be way more critical of what you&amp;#8217;re shooting, what you see; instead of hitting the button and then looking to see what I can do better, I find myself making those checks (frame edges, composition, etc.) before I click the shutter. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Another thing: developing film is the closest thing to magic us mere mortals can do. Roll the film onto the developing reels in the dark, then put on the lid, turn on the lights, and run it through the developer (FG-7, if you care), the stop bath, and the fixer, and then you can pull out the negatives and see all of your pictures at once. It&amp;#8217;s the most boring regular process ever, but at the end you have these perfect little jewels, full of potential. Anyway, look for some shots from film here soonish.

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really have much memory of taking these pictures. Apparently I was falling asleep, waking up for a few seconds, snapping a photo and falling back asleep.

          <title>not drinking...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I haven&amp;#8217;t had anything to drink in three or four days, and I&amp;#8217;m stating to notice a difference. I can type faster; My pool game is better; I see pictures just a little quicker, focus better. My memory too, it seems improved. But it took me until today to really see any improvement, even a subjective one. I like it; it&amp;#8217;s like the moment when I got my first pair of glasses and could actually see better. Drinking is fun, but this might be better. I figure some moderate consumption won&amp;#8217;t hurt me, but I&amp;#8217;m gonna keep going for at least a week, see what happens.Anyway, photos coming soonish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;These are from my show opening. The show is still up, but not for much longer. Also, this was the first time I&amp;#8217;ve shot film in ages, and it came out all right, for me not having a light meter.

          <title>light out for a day</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Took a little road trip to the Wichita Mountains, which are nowhere near Wichita, Kansas, incidentally. Berlin (second photo) came along and took pictures too. You can see her photos form that day on her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessica_berlin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt;. I finally got to try a meers burger, which was good, but their onion rings weren&amp;#8217;t that great. Irma&amp;#8217;s is better. It was a nice chill day to get away from the city and see some sights.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0053.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0055.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0056.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0057.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0059.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0060.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0061.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Yep, it&amp;#8217;s happening again; Youths on bikes out terrorize the local bar scene.

          <title>Paseo fest</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Not many pictures from this night made it through the edit filter. oh well. I have a tendency to try to make a narrative with photo series, but some nights just don&amp;#8217;t fall into that pattern. Too much going on to get it all, or too much happening in bad light, etc. And sometimes my narrative making brain cells aren&amp;#8217;t firing either. Of course, the gist of what happened is what you see in these photos, even if there isn&amp;#8217;t a series of them. We drank. We chilled. That&amp;#8217;s about it.

          <title>Moving on...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;And then that night I began the business of figuring out how to function again. I met this chick who seemed all right but turned out to be totally psycho. Or turned psycho after drinking. I have a photo of her, but I really don&amp;#8217;t feel like posting it. I seem to attract the crazies lately. Oh well, c&amp;#8217;est la vie.

          <title>Adam's memorial ride</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There would be more of these, but I didn&amp;#8217;t much feel like taking pictures. Wasn&amp;#8217;t totally together. I was sad and not really functioning so well. But the ride helped, and the funeral (minus the pastors that didn&amp;#8217;t really know adam) was good. The ride after, without the police escort, was better. We took over the street, up broadway and down 23rd, a critical mass like this city hasn&amp;#8217;t seen in a while. It was kinda epic, which fitted with what I was feeling at the time. Maybe you had to be there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0019.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0021.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>I just don't know what to do with myself...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;By which I mean I have the white stripes in my head. I&amp;#8217;ve been reading this book, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Photographer-War-torn-Afghanistan-Doctors-Without/dp/B003F76HKC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1276983196&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Photographer&lt;/a&gt;, about a photog who went into afghanistan with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msf.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MSF&lt;/a&gt; during the Soviet-Afghan war. Towards the middle of the book, the photographer and one of the doctors are talking about what it takes to improve in their respective professions, and the doctor says to the photog: &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;To take good photos, you have to age well.&amp;#8221; I like that sentiment very much. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;All of these look a little yellow to me now, but I&amp;#8217;m not going to go back and correct &amp;#8216;em. Too much like work. I&amp;#8217;m having a really great day thus far. Bike ride, hangin&amp;#8217; out, big truck burrito, and now I&amp;#8217;m huddled next to my ac tryin to cool off. The hot laptop isn&amp;#8217;t much help, but oh well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremay/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>my first time at the arbor</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a sweet space. Really big, and then had a lot of cool shit there for the show, plus some live work too. Some painters painting during the show for our entertainment. Which, come to think of it, is a little odd. Painting isn&amp;#8217;t usually performative, but I was entertained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/may10/0016.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/may10/0017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/may10/0018.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/may10/0019.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;single photos, that is. Clouds and the Cinco de Mayo dance party at iguana.

          <description>&lt;p&gt;They were new at one time, why not give them some love? These poor neglected photos need a home. Think of the photos.

          <title>For Adam...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I already posted these to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/1440875@N23/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;flickr group&lt;/a&gt;, but here they are again. For those of you that didn&amp;#8217;t know him, Adam was a really amazing guy. Nice, dependable, humble, an all around good guy, even after all he&amp;#8217;d been through. He&amp;#8217;s already missed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Elder Hellkat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photomattmills.com/images/adam/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photomattmills.com/images/adam/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

There&amp;#8217;s a memorial bike ride for him starting at Sauced, 1pm on Friday; the car procession will follow the bikes, so anybody in cars who wants to join should be there. Memorial Services are at 2pm at Frontline church, 6th and broadway. The reception is afterwards at the prohibition room, in the gold dome, 23rd and western.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;of photos to post, after these. Well, there are more, but they&amp;#8217;re not edited.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Ha. There are so many things that word could mean as a teaser! I could do a poll, what did you think matt mills meant when he said &amp;#8216;out&amp;#8217;? Out of town? Out of his mind? How do you feel about me talking about myself in the third person?

          <title>a dream and some photos</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, last night I had this dream that I got to egypt and somehow had forgotten my cameras, all of them, and all I could get was a film camera, and the only film I could find was ISO 100 color film, and 120-size black and white. Thought you&amp;#8217;d like to know that. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Also of note: If you&amp;#8217;re staying at my house and happen to see me before I shower and wake up for a couple hours, I&amp;#8217;m not really human yet. Cro-magnon or something till about noon.

          <title>advice from @busblog</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;from the world famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.tonypierce.com/2010/05/somebody-turns-24-tomorrow-bob-d-tp3.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;busblog&lt;/a&gt;, tony answers questions sometimes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Kurtis: How do you get over someone?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

the only way is to get sloppy with several others. keyword: get. all this moping around, writing poems, feeling the depths of depression, etc - all thats played out. its the road most traveled. its for losers. its for the madding crowd. its for people who revolve their schedules around nickleback. first thing you should do this weekend is get a date, make some moves, and think about las vegas. yes you&amp;#8217;ll feel horrible. but you were gonna feel horrible anyways. at least now when you wake up their will be stale champagne on the nightstand. and if youre lucky, it wont be all that stale.&lt;br/&gt;
+ + +
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
so true. and the champagne the next day is never stale if they&amp;#8217;re making mimosas with it. And since I have several exes who read this, all of &amp;#8216;em but you, babe.</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the last show I saw, because at this point I could barely walk. Like, man I was tired. I drove home and I don&amp;#8217;t even know how I made it. So tired. These are all with the 500, but none of the exposures were particularly long, a good thing in a jostling crowd mere feet form the mosh pit.

          <title>NMF in Many Parts (sunday brunch)</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, Amber was kind enough to let me and Chas and her bro crash at her house, even leaving the front door open so we didn&amp;#8217;t have to leave the party when she did. The next morning, Amber and josh and I had brunch at the Norman Airport. It&amp;#8217;s a place to go to based on novelty, because the service sucked and the food wasn&amp;#8217;t even as good as ihop.

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The number of things going on in this picture is at least double what you think it is. And then there&amp;#8217;s all the things that happened that night that aren&amp;#8217;t in the picture. A couple good rock bands, a hillbilly jug of sangria, a foamy (but free) keg, etc. etc. If I sat here and actually listed everything, you&amp;#8217;d get bored and never read again. You had to be there.

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I have this thing about making the page not get too slow to load, and because I feel like people look the individual images better when there aren&amp;#8217;t 21232283 pictures to look at, the NMF stuff will be broken up a bit. This is the first night, second or third show. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I feel like if I were really to describe my life, I&amp;#8217;d be another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.number27.org/today.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;johnathan harris&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s so weird and wonderful and straight up surreal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, evidence:

          <title>Clouds</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been doing this thing now for the past couple weeks, when I see a cloud that I like, for whatever reason, I take a picture. Clouds are the ultimate transients. Impossible to pin down. The way the light plays on them is so &lt;i&gt;dramatic&lt;/i&gt;, as if they have moods. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Anyway, I&amp;#8217;m thinking of using these for a show I have coming up. I know, I&amp;#8217;m becoming that pretentious asshole I never wanted to become. Whatever, I&amp;#8217;ll probably come up with something better like 48 hours before the show and rush around getting it done in the nick of time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newcamera/0012.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>NMF Pre-Gaming With Sherree Chamberlain</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;And by pre-gaming, I mean I went to a show, to warm me up for all the other shows. I could have used a drink, as this was a TV taping and all those cameras made me kinda nervous, but after a couple takes I got used to them and was able just to enjoy the music. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Why I was there exactly is a little complicated- a friend is a PA or something for the show, and I ran into her when I was in Stillwater a couple months ago at a show, and she asked me to do some stills for them, so I did. And I guess as a thank-you and because they needed warm bodies in the seats, I got to go to the on set taping of the show, Warehouse something or other. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Before the show, waiting on the rehearsals to get done. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/coupleweeks/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The 500mm does its thing. 1/50th of a second baby! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/coupleweeks/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Still 1/50th. Little blurry this time, but I still like it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/coupleweeks/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Sharp? what? Yeah. I&amp;#8217;m kinda in love with what that lens can do. It&amp;#8217;s hard to focus and hard to use, but the stuff it does is unique.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/coupleweeks/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>sunset walk</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a weird ass day&amp;#8230; I keep doing that thing you&amp;#8217;re supposed to do in lucid dreams where you look at everything twice, to tell if I&amp;#8217;m awake or not. Man, people in the hospital, (everyone is fine now as far as I know) sudden revelations, breakfast tacos, madness.  
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Yesterday, I lost my voice. I said to Reaghan: &amp;#8220;I took a shot of Tom Waits,&amp;#8221; because when I could talk, that&amp;#8217;s who I sounded like. This morning, eating my taco, I heard in my head his reading of Bukowski&amp;#8217;s poem &amp;#8220;Nirvana&amp;#8221;: &amp;#8220;Not much chance. Completely cut loose from purpose&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; Oh the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-have-an-ipodin-my-mind,10912/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ipod of the mind&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Anyway, here are some entirely unrelated photos:

          <title>Scissortail Space</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been volunteering at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scissortailokc.wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scissortail social space&lt;/a&gt; the last couple weeks, helping out with their bike shop- it&amp;#8217;s all pay as you can/free. If you&amp;#8217;re having bike problems, come by wednesday after 2, and I&amp;#8217;ll be glad to help. I mean, look at that truing stand.

They also have a decent-sized lending library, lots of good books that I have a feeling are hard to find in the MLS libraries. So come hang out, have some coffee (if we have any) and fix yo&amp;#8217; bike. It&amp;#8217;s just south of the corner of 30th and walker, &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;amp;q=3012+N.+Walker+Oklahoma+City,+OK&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=3012+N+Walker+Ave,+Oklahoma+City,+Oklahoma,+73103&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ei=o0jTS8r1OcT_lgel_rjsDA&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA&amp;amp;ll=35.500107,-97.521622&amp;amp;spn=0.008044,0.012767&amp;amp;z=17&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=35.500164,-97.521014&amp;amp;panoid=HTWxLowF16IFz1QCax8YGA&amp;amp;cbp=12,102.31,,0,-5.13&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, next to the AA Food Mart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>The benefits of coworking...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://okccoco.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OKC CoCo&lt;/a&gt; for the last month or so now, and it&amp;#8217;s a really great environment. I mean, not to sound like an advertisement. The concept of it is solid, though. Mostly, it&amp;#8217;s getting work done, but there are all these really smart people around, also working, to bounce ideas off of and build relationships with. Most places I go it&amp;#8217;s very hard to talk about my day job, the things I have to bitch about don&amp;#8217;t even make sense to people who haven&amp;#8217;t struggled with what turns out to be a missing } 300 lines up for hours. Anyway, yeah:

Full disclosure: I get my membership in exchange for shooting events for the CoCo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;if you look very closely, and can read backwards, you can see the sign says &amp;#8220;night work.&amp;#8221; Which is what driving is, or should be.

So, as I was leaving McNellies one night, this girl asks if if she can try my hat on. I say, only if I can take your picture. And then I got my hat back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I know I already posted this to twitter once, but a little backstory would be nice maybe. I&amp;#8217;m always out in Midwest City on tuesdays, and I usually go home via surface streets, but I decided to take the highway to try and beat the storms. Of course, I ended up in the middle of it, and I had to try to take pictures of the lightning while driving down the road. And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Sunday...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Was peaceful and really nice. A calm day with a good drunk at the right end of it. Also, got to hang out with: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/aprilfoolish/0020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, even though you only see her knees/hands/arms, Victoria was there too.

And then I met (or re-met, depending on how drunk you have to be on a first meeting for it not to count) Jessica: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/aprilfoolish/0022.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A good day. 

And I know I went and got these pictures up mad quick. Don&amp;#8217;t get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>The day after</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;well, that might not have been the end of the night, but the pics got either not so good or at least repetitive (I photograph my obsessions at my best, and when I&amp;#8217;m drunk it gets worse), so we&amp;#8217;re moving on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

This is the next day. Holly, mourning. And then getting ready to go to work. And then the cat.

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to shout that at him whenever I see him, mostly because I tend to be shitfaced when I run into him. Anyway, he was there, in austin, at the donut shop with the ganesha mural outside.

          <title>Austin Night 2</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the night I randomly walked into a kings of leon set, and then walked out again because the hippy smell was unbearable. That, and they sounded exactly like they do on CD.

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Driving around one morning. Not sure what I was doing. Still not sure what I&amp;#8217;m doing, in fact.

          <title>The Austin Weekend</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Last time I wrote anything here, I was just waking up the morning after these were shot. Two (or three?) weeks later, I finally get my shit together again. This is the first night, drinking beer and hanging out with Neil.

          <title>under way...</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;m in austin as I write this. I&amp;#8217;m as surprised as you. Just so you know, going from stuck in the office to packed and under way to fun and adventure and really wild things in like half an hour is the _best_ feeling. That, and I don&amp;#8217;t mind missing the snow. 

&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;We left just as the storms ere arriving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/stpattysetc/0017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;On the road. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/stpattysetc/0018.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>The first rule of MashUp camp</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Is you don&amp;#8217;t talk about mashup camp. The second rule is pay attention and forget to take photos because you&amp;#8217;re too engaged with the ideas of what&amp;#8217;s going on. Or at least that&amp;#8217;s what happened to me. This is from the McNellie&amp;#8217;s, afterward.

big backlog to work through. Like I said on twitter, covering the LCD of my camera has made a difference. that, and maybe a certain lady who I&amp;#8217;m going to remain coy about in public until I know it&amp;#8217;s cool. Keep on rockin&amp;#8217;, updates on the 3&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Walking in the snow</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This was last sunday, and things were just at that stage of melting that we could play with really large chunks of ice. And now I&amp;#8217;m out of backlog to work with, so I have to get more photos off the camera. Wah-hoo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0026.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0027.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0028.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>RAISING HAITI</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;You should all come out to this show, all proceeds from the door go to the Red Cross Haiti relief effort. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loveokc.com/calendar/12471932/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Linkage.&lt;/a&gt;  RSVP, fuckers. 
&lt;br/&gt;

The photos are from the first show, which they&amp;#8217;re just repeating because of the storm. Mo&amp;#8217; money, less pain and suffering. Although that&amp;#8217;s not much of a slogan, it&amp;#8217;s true. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Rex, who organized the whole thing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0023.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/oh_tootie&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@oh_tootie&lt;/a&gt; at the first show. There&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loveokc.com/calendar/12471932/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strike&gt;tomorrow&lt;/strike&gt;tonight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0022.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Last post on blogger</title>
          <description>Well, this is the 371st post, and probably the last here on blogger. It's been a good run; with this and other blogs, I've been using blogger for going on five years (ha ha), but now they're stopping ftp uploading, and while I understand that, it's something I need, or at least that I really want. for the time being, I'll be posting at &lt;a href=&quot;http://photomattmills.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;photomattmills.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;, and in the long term I'll be trying to extract the posts from this blog and put up something here that is more or less a redesigned and better Five Years. We'll see.</description>

          <title>a saturday somewhere in there.</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the night after I moved in to my new apartment. A good night.

          <title>Cute Couples Night?</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Shit, I don&amp;#8217;t know if they&amp;#8217;re even still together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m posting two nearly identical photos. The first one because I think it&amp;#8217;s funny, and the second one because I figure they&amp;#8217;ll want it. 
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Again, two photos. But I figure they&amp;#8217;ll want both. 
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0012.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0013.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This would have been a good way to end the night for him, if not for the rule that the first to pass out is fair game for sharpie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wholelottajanuary/0014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>ICEPOCALYPSE</title>
          <description>Yes, I'm annoyed by my own title.. but I do it because I know so many of you will also be frowning, and that makes me laugh. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went for a walk, down to Grant's house to make coffee, and he had some interesting news which I'm not sure I can share yet, not the big Ruby news, but something else really cool for him personally. All I can say is damn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Just another wanderer. &quot;I'll be all right, as long as I have some traction,&quot; he told me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This was rush hour, on 23rd street... never seen it this dead at that hour. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yeah, there was all this white stuff on the ground. god's cocaine party. Mostly sleet, though, not the fine white powder all kids and skiers love. Blowing wind, sleet in my face, and there I was, taking pictures. It's a 15 minute walk that took me about 20 due to detours.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I do love these lights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good coffee at Grant's, Then I walked to dinner at Mcnellie's.  I kept drinking after dinner, getting drunk and thinking about hard math problems in my head. I always know I've had a long day at the computer when I'm thinking about math, drunk. (was it three or four pints? I was only there an hour and a half, must have been three). Yeah, Snow and Ice and everything nice. I'm going back to bed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/icestorm/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>A typical sunday night...</title>
          <description>As usual, these are a week delayed, so from 8 days ago. Sundays up at classics are pretty excellent though. More (and less blurry) pics from this last sunday coming soon, I promise. I just realized that none of these are in classics, which is just where we start, after all, not always where we finish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Boring club in Bricktown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Exciting moment in the boring club in bricktown. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Random encounter outside the club.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <description>From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americansuburbx.com/2008/01/theory-interview-with-garry-winogrand.html&quot;&gt;American Suburb X&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Interviewer: If you don't like &quot;street photographer,&quot; how do you respond to that other Ã¦tiresome phrase', &quot;snapshot aesthetic&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winogrand: I knew that was coming. That's another stupidity. The people who use the term don't even know the meaning. They use it to refer to photographs they believe are loosely organized, or casually made, whatever you want to call it. Whatever terms you like. The fact is, when they're talking about snapshots they're talking about the family album picture, which is one of the most precisely made photographs. Everybody's fifteen feet away and smiling. The sun is over the viewer's shoulder. That's when the picture is taken, always. It's one of the most carefully made photographs that ever happened. People are just dumb. They misunderstand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should read the whole thing.</description>

          <title>One Long Saturday</title>
          <description>Last saturday was a very long, very good day... it had phases, I did things. I walked the dog with Damaris, then hung out with her and Grant and some other kids for sdinner and drunken fry, and then down to makers and bricktown for fog and fun. Makers is where god would hang out, if he was looking for a jazz club in this town. And the Fog... yeah, it gets a capitol letter. Good stuff. The fog outside lifted the fog inside, if you will. And if you won't, well, too bad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>Since I can't sleep</title>
          <description>I'm gonna post some photos. Two wednesdays ago, I found myself at hooters. No, really. Talk about the ass-end of the restaurant business... I'm told the girls that wait there at least make a lot of money. Good for them, now they just need to work on the food. (These girls, for those of you that don't know them, aren't hooters girls, just friends). Then I went to the new Blue Note. It was weird times 20. Times 10^100. Maybe not that weird; there were no green monsters or invading Persians. Not even any mild-mannered persians. But weird. And cleaner. Anyway, photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rebounding/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>More from early January</title>
          <description>Because if I don't just do one big post with these, I'll never get them all out, and that would be a tragedy. These are somewhat random; I find myself going out a lot at night. It's the insomnia more than anything; since I'm going to be up anyway, I figure I might as well not be sitting at home bored to death. And I know I've been saying that I want to get away from the 'photos of drunk friends' (or drunken photos of friends) thing, but here they are again anyway. I drink, I take pictures, it's bound to happen. The last photo Kat took, by the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>Starting off right</title>
          <description>So, this is how we brought in the new year, with chicken pot pie and soup and baked goods. I was so full after that lunch, I didn't eat until lunch the next day. Yes, these are cutesy family photos. I DO WHAT I WANT. Nyah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <description>that it's two weeks into the new year, and I'm just now posting these from NYE, but whatever. You'll take what you get and like it. Or not.

          <title>Last photos from 09</title>
          <description>yeah, the title says it all. I just rode my bike to work, pretty proud of that. The best part: I wasn't once afraid for my life as cars passed. So that's better. Anyway, photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>Back in Blog</title>
          <description>Yeah, i had another one of those lulls. Always happens. NYE and the surrounding weeks found me unable to drink without getting massive hangovers and as usual, some depression, which wasn't helped by my inability to shoot photos, so the whole thing kind of spiraled downwards so much so that I don't want to be the man with the camera anymore. This is what I feared the most when I took the programming job; by filling my head with something else, there isn't room for the photography. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Look at this hipster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, we all know that's bullshit. I'm as much a photographer as I was then, and this is just a temporary setback. I'm gonna get my chops back, by hook or by crook, and all will be well with the world. And for the record, I have taken a few good photos, just not as many as I'd like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Before the freakin' blizzard, or maybe after. Shit conditions to be out in, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newyearsplus/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <description>yeah, I'm not one for news pictures so much... the news is all fake anyway, or at least 90% bullshit to 10% truth... but I do like the snow. So, for once, a topical post. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <description>I was at the blue note... this was the night I found out someone new was buying it, definitely bittersweet... but the sweet was good, too, Hanging out w/ Kat and Sigrid and Kat's fam (her dad is a pool shark, watchout), and then just the drinking, oh, the drinking... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>the last december birthday</title>
          <description>Mike J's. At the Sipango. And you might think, from these pictures, that it's not a bad place to hang out. You'd be wrong. I wouldn't go there again unless it's someone's birthday, and they won't see reason and come to a bar with less dudebros. The things we do for our friends. Actually, I only stayed for half an hour, everybody was already pretty well wasted by the time I got there. Although I did have dinner and some beers earlier at Mcnellies that night, I wasn't &lt;span &gt;drinking&lt;/span&gt;, if you know what I mean. Tuesday, you know? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/christmas09/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>It's been seven days since...</title>
          <description>I took all these photos. Ok, in that last post, where I said I hadn't taken any good ones of Ali when we were celebrating her bday? I lied. There's one here that I really like and another that's all right, but it's not her face. What else? That was a dfry night, which is becoming more and more common now that blue note has changed the jukebox. My favorite bar is changing owners very soon... this has happened once before, and that change brought us ladies night and free pool afternoons, but we lost good show coming out of there, so maybe this time we'll keep the free beer and get back some awesome shows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there are the two pictures in here that aren't portraits. I'm becoming more impulsive with my photography, and that off ramp was an extreme example. I glanced out of the bar door, saw something, and had a compulsion to go out and shoot it. That's all I came up with; although there are several frames, I only like that one. What else? Holly, you'd better be treating my hat well. Regular walks, exercise, hand wash only. Now I have to get photos off the camera. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0043.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0044.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0045.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0046.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0047.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0048.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0049.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0050.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0051.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0052.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>two fridays ago...</title>
          <description>This was the night of Ali's birthday... sorry ali, didn't get any of you, as you were in tulsa... the following night I also didn't get any, because the light in the dfry is shit.  Also, I'm not shooting as much as I used to. it ebbs and flows, just like everything else, and right now, I'm at an ebb... I've just had an idea for a new project, though, one that's been staring me in the face for months and me not even noticing. The working title is 'hackers in the heartland'... a hacker in the sense of 'maker' or 'expert'. You know who you are, expect emails soon. Anyway, on with the photos. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0038.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0039.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0040.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0042.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>Office christmas party, pt 1</title>
          <description>You know, you;d think the office christmas party would be boring, and nothing would really happen. And I suppose I did end up driving myself home that night, so it wasn't that crazy. But still, it requires two posts to get all the photos in. Here: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0023.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0024.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0025.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0026.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0027.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0028.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0029.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0030.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <description>nobody could believe what was happening... I could scarcely deal with it myself... I mean, look at these girls... and I wasn't on my game, just imagine what was actually happening... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seriously though, I need to do some catch up on photos... these are seriously stale... expect a post every three hours until I'm caught up to what's in the camera right now. no promises that the front text will make any more sense than this one did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0021.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0022.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>I think this was that one night...</title>
          <description>Remember? The night that I drank far far too much? Excessive amounts of excess. So hungover in the morning I couldn't move? Yeah, well, there was this artshow, and I was broke, and a lot of other people fed me booze, but I wasn't really keeping track. I started counting in the morning, and the number of drinks I had was some where in excess of &lt;span &gt;way too many&lt;/span&gt;. I think my short term memory shorted out there at the end, I have a lot of the same picture, like I took it and then forgot. Not that I remember now, but the photos at least tell something. Artifacts. Thank god for autofocus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I know, deadpan images are dead, but I liked the asshole tax.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Husband...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;and wife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>five minutes for a blog post...</title>
          <description>first one will be brief. This is from two wednesdays ago, for once I wasn't out at blue note, and Chelsea came down to get a cell phone (I have spares and hers was spastic). While I was looking for the charger, she says, &quot;Why don't we go to norman and see my friends play a jazz set?&quot; and of course I went. I always have some fantastic luck when I hang out with her; I met a former South African paratrooper at one party, or there was the time we came across fire-dancers just before a rock show, etc, etc. This time, one of the professors from OU showed up and asked to sit in, and dude was cool. Didn't hog the stage, played a couple good numbers, and left. And my five minutes were up a while ago: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Trumpet playin' man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oneweekindec/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More later.</description>

          <title>Pearl Goes Away</title>
          <description>It seems like every weekend, we have and excuse to party... and if there is no party, we at least have a reason to drink. Anyway, I know these are like a week and a half late, but I really had far too much fun at this party and the day after... I've had a lot of good days in the past moth or so, and this was one of them (or at least that night and the next morning). The kind of good time that makes me want to hang onto certain pictures, even though they're not as good. When I rush to post, that's when you see 40 pictures split into two posts; when I wait, you get 7 pictures in one post, but I think they're the best 7. Anyway, on with the show: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pearlgoesaway/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>Return to the Fry</title>
          <description>So, a couple weeks ago now, I was in the Drunken fry and some dudebro tried to steal my hat and then start a fight with Cody. This was a mistake on his part, and, well, nothing happened, not really. But I'd been avoiding the fry after that, because who wants to deal with that shit? Anyway, last friday a bunch of us started the night getting smashed and playing dominoes, at which point going to the fry sounded like a good idea. And then there weren't enough seats in the car, so I said &quot;Fuck it, I'll ride my bike.&quot; And it was awesome and cold, but mostly awesome. And then drunken, and then fries, in phases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/returnfry/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>friendsgiving part 2</title>
          <description>Some good discussion over on my facebook with Kris Kanaly re: that last post where I said the oughts sucked in a lot of ways. If you can read it you should, I don't feel like re-hashing a lot of stuff here. A note on the nature of this blog: I post the photos for other people to see, and I write stuff for myself. It's always rough and nothing I say here is ever final or complete. Also: I didn't mean that there was nothing good happening anywhere, just that only a few pieces of art (and by art I mean writing, painting , photography, and any creative endeavour) were what I'd call transformative, that stick with you, that change you, that have a lasting effect. Then I realized, on reflection, that a small number of works like that might be normal. Not that the worlds sucks, but you don't make the mona lisa every day, either. A fault, but I think the rest of the argument stands- reducing noise and increasing good signal is a good thing.

          <title>some thoughts and some random</title>
          <description>I've been thinking, a lot of people are saying what a craptastic decade this has been, calling it the 'naughts' because that's what it ammounts to. The whole world and every single one of us in it has had kind of a shitty time. There are a few gleaming shiny bits of technology and a lot of death and hate and crap and that's about it. Music has gone to hell. I haven't seen any art that really floored me since about 2003, and all of that was made before 2000. What the hell, people? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have one answer- it's not all of the answer, because so much shit comes from a lot of assholes- but for the first time ever, we have access to everything we want, ever. You know that impulse you have to look at every title in the bookstore at least once, so you don't miss anything? Or to go through all the rooms in the thrift store, for that one special find? That same impulse combined with the internet and the exponential growth of things available to look at has completely consumed our collective conscious. It's normal to be obsessed with something, and it's weird to be disconnected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the catch: &lt;span &gt;obsessives are crazy&lt;/span&gt;. Not the good crazy, the stay up for three weeks on benzedrine and write the great american novel crazy, but the found dead in her house with two dead cats under piles of used toilet paper rolls crazy. We have been so obsessed with mining all that is out there and finding the gems that we have made no time to create our own identity. You think to yourself if you can just finish this season of lost or get that Eames chair or write the perfect tweet, then you can be at peace, but that's a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, there is no such thing as being finished. There is no rest until you're dead, and no safety either. And as long as you spend your time keeping up with the latest and greatest of the whole world and all of your friends, you will have no time for yourself, to make the world a better place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not saying to cut yourself off from twitter and facebook and all of that. They are wonderful tools for communication, and they should be used that way. You are not a one person broadcast to the world; you're leaving a note for your friends. You can't keep up with everything, so you might as well take the time to do something that's worth sharing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I realize the inherent contradiction, putting this on my blog. Where the hell else am I going to put it? Why share something like this in a channel nobody cares about any more, like a dumb old magazine or newspaper. This is the fucking future, and we didn't get our flying cars and vacations around venus and all that shit, but we did get blogs and iphones and all the tools we could ever dream of for making the world however we want it. Let's let go of the old shit and get out there and create something of our own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough rant. I hope you read it and didn't skip to the photos, even though I like these photos. I have more in this vein, including an expansion of what I mean about not being a broadcast for the whole world, but that's another rant, and there are plenty of photos to bait you all with later, no? ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam lock Was back in ton for like two seconds, and these are two from that night at Mcnellies. Have fun kids, and look for freindsgiving photos tomorrow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/onlock/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/onlock/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>Calories</title>
          <description>I just found out that 20% of the calories you burn are burned by your brain. Does that mean, then, that people with super high metabolism can think more and/or faster? Endurance athletes: ultramarathon runners, touring cyclists who do 80+ miles a day, anybody at the olympics, people like that. Can prolonged exercise make you smarter just by making the processor run hotter?</description>

          <title>people come back to town for a holiday</title>
          <description>Somebody this weekend asked me this weekend, in a pointed, trying-to-give-advice kind of way, why I hang out with the people I do... as if there are better people somewhere. The truth is it's damn hard to find people I can talk to, I need all the friends I can get. Real people, people who don't fuck with trivialities. They sure as hell have their faults, but so do I. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of friends, of real people... a bunch of people came back into town last week for the holiday, all of whom I was glad to see. This is mostly about them, and the next few posts, too... it's been a good break. Now back to the grind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Rayguns and Devin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/txgiving/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/txgiving/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Caitlin, in from Austin fo a day, then gone the next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/txgiving/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I flew a kite that day, and it was fun even though the wind was weak sauce.

          <title>a bunch of people I don't know in stillwater</title>
          <description>well, I do know the guests of honor, the Chelseas. This was a fun party until the cops came and I had to walk two miles back to Chelsea's house... never earned a night on a couch more. Well, maybe I have... there was that time in Brazil... or that time... well, anyway, I seem to just stay exhausted these days. No rest for the wicked.

          <title>had a thought walking to 7-11</title>
          <description>so, I was thinking about twitter... and social media in general... a mistake most so-called experts make is thinking of little updates as &lt;span &gt;broadcasting&lt;/span&gt;, when really it's &lt;span &gt;backchannel&lt;/span&gt;. You have a hundred twitter followers that also follow you, you're inside that circle of people, messaging them things that are irrelevant or unimportant to the rest of the world, but that they might find useful/entertaining/funny. Non-sequiturs. The useful information that you get from the chatter are the things you wouldn't have found otherwise. Most importantly, it's &lt;span &gt;behind the scenes&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's true for most twitter users, I'd bet. Then there are the &quot;experts&quot; who think of twitter as a place to sell stuff; it's a free way to shout things about your product, after all. The problem is, when seen in the light of the above: all advertising on twitter is effectively noise. If your product is good, it will get word of mouth (actually, you'll get more word of mouth if it's bad or easy to make fun of; see snuggies, slap-chop, etc.). </description>

          <title>the last bike against hunger pics until the next one...</title>
          <description>Man, there've been a lot of these events. What is is about people on bikes and donating to charity? Anyway, these rae from the first weekend, when everybody just rode. The second weekend, I didn't really take any photos, I was was processing all of these for your ass. But more people showed then and money and cans were raised, so hopefully some people got fed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0021.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0022.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0023.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0024.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0025.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0026.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>not cursing in the title.</title>
          <description>fuck it. I was going to write something but instead I cut it because let's face it, even I don't want to listen to my bullshit long enough to write it. The photos, though, I could stare at for hours... not that I do, you think I have time for that? no, I'm to busy doing your mothers. All of them, alphabetically. I'm all the way to 'c' now. Enough bullshit, time for the love:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Random ass night at the hell house. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;More hell house, in the kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The real hell cat?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Yeah, alien spaceship shit, because I roll like that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Or just the inside of the concert hall. There were people inside speechifying and I was kind of embarassed that they are the good guys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>yeah, yeah, I know...</title>
          <description>I haven't been posting. I have a shit ton of photos, and they're all uploaded now, so my only excuse is that I'm usually pretty tired of the computer at the end of the day and don't have the energy to write a whole lot or stare at the screen for an extra hour or two to put something together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these rae from the beginning photo class I taught at OKCCoCo - I only had four people show up, so it was a little bit of a letdown, but at least I was able to answer some questions and maybe the people learned some things. I said a lot, I know that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/november/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>Things I should be doing</title>
          <description>1. Getting ready for the first Oklahoma Citizen meeting wednesday-yes, the newspaper has a name, tentatively. I need to make an agenda, decide what I'm going to say, maybe put together a powerpoint, etc. etc. It's a lot of prep work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Laundry- I wore one clean sock today and one dirty sock. Enough said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. House Cleaning- literally. My room has once more transformed into a series of piles, and the bathroom hasn't been scrubbed in a couple weeks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Physical therapy exercises- these take about ten minutes, and I'll probably do them right after I get done writing this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Promote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/909837&quot;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt;. Done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Process some of the pictures from the last few weeks. (The ones you're seeing here are from just after halloween. I have a bunch still in the camera from after that even). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's it. My todo list for right now. What I should be doing. Instead, I'm waiting on a phone call to go out and celebrate somebody's birthday. No names, I am a gentleman after all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleeping/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>what's next?</title>
          <description>this is always on my mind. For a very long time, I've been casting about, trying to find my way through the world, and it's been a ripping good time. I've got a good job now, one that will eventually afford me a great deal of freedom, assuming I don't get tied down with a wife and kids and mortgage and all the trappings of modern life that are really just a trap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a curve though. I'm starting at zero: zero knowledge of the stuff I'm doing, zero time to do anything but sleep and work, zero money, and zero photos taken since I started the job on tuesday. these will all help each other though: As I learn the job, I'll have more time to get out and do things; as soon as I have a paycheck, I'll have more money in hand than I've had in months; and of course, there will be more photos. (I just checked; there are a couple photos on the camera, but nothing of consequence). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing, I guess: I've realized that you don't have to be all one thing; that is, you can do a lot of different things, do them well, and it's not that you're letting go of one thing for another, it's that you're able to do both, and that all of your activities inform one another. It's a good thing I've come to this realization, because it's a really bad time to be trying to make money off of photography. (I'm not going to go into details, but someone was pissed at me recently because they thought I was putting out a certain photo for a profit, and it made me laugh. I've never made money off of what I consider my real work, the portraits, the documentary projects, etc). </description>

          <title>The Morning after...</title>
          <description>So these are the last of them, except a coupla skate sequences... This was fun. And now, I've got a regular job, I'm going to be boring, but the good news is it's at least interesting work... learning a new programming language, plus a library or two, plus a new super complicated framework... all marketable skills, things I can use to get a job telecommuting from anywhere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&quot;hey guys, let's go get food and make a big brunch.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0072.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Made their money back, at least. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0073.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Feast in preparation.

          <description>Don't be mad if I cut a picture you liked; they're still in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/photomattmills/sets/72157622720538580/&quot;&gt;flickr set&lt;/a&gt;, but I wanted to trim this some.

          <title>so I lied...</title>
          <description>I was going to just be lazy and post the photos to flickr and be done, but some of these need captions and comments and snarkiness. Also, I think more people will see them this way. These are split into three posts, so as not to hurt your page load time and my bandwidth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, a technical note- these pictures wouldn't have been possible without clever deployment of the on camera flash and a little reflector to bounce it off of the ceiling/walls. If you want to learn stuff like that, why not come to &lt;a href=&quot;http://services.okccoco.com/classes/detail/50&quot;&gt;the class I'm teaching at the coco next week&lt;/a&gt;? /blatant plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Getting ready to race. Tanner hadn't ridden a bike in two months and took fourth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;At my checkpoint, I made them do pushups. &quot;I hate you,&quot; Cody said, as he jumped back on his bike.

All the comic book nerds know what I'm talking about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Unfortunately, both dominatrixpizza.com and hotgirlseatingpizza.com are taken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This is what happens when you run smack into a car that doesn't give you your right of way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The look on her face is really worse than the bruise and small hematoma he had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;No comment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/hal09/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Hey Look!

          <description>So, there's a lot of photos from last saturday, and rather than split it up into three or four posts, I'm just going to post this handy flickr gallery and call it a day. It was really epic.

          <description>before all the madness that is about to rain down on us, let's pause and just relax and have a mimosa: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mimosabreak.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>Open Beta After Party</title>
          <description>I'm not going to bore you, my more general audience, with event photos of Open Beta. The fun stuff, as always, was at the afterparty. Some people might notice curious black spots in a couple of the photos; this is where that someone has been removed from the background. This person has especially delicate privacy issues (read: other journalists might be interested in harming him and his, and that's not what these photos are for), and I have to respect that. Odd social circles I find myself travelling in these days. Anyway, the photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0012.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0013.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0015.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0016.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0018.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0019.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbetaparty/0020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>The state of the economy: flea markets</title>
          <description>now, you'd think that with everything going to hell in a handbasket, you expect to see flea markets like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fleamarkets/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but then we went to another, and it was better:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fleamarkets/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win some, lose some.

          <title>A brief post about bicycles</title>
          <description>just to frustrate the people waiting for KRONDOR pictures. Don't worry, I'm onto that next, I'm even skipping the openbeta stuff to get to it. But anyway: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Science Museum (their real name, no kidding) here in the city has a little exhibit on antique bicycles, or the development of the bike, or something like that. Really cool, I want two of everything they have on display. including that steam powered bike. that's pretty rad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Lori looks at an original boneshaker. She was there on assignment from to see some exhibit in the photo hall of fame, and got me in for free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/antique/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Harley moped with suicide shifter! OMG.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/antique/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Steampunk bike. Or is is still steampunk when it's actually a steam engine?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/antique/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I would ride the hell outta this wooden fixie piece of awesome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/antique/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>it's been days since....</title>
          <description>I last posted, and these photos aren't what everybody is waiting on, but hey, all the selects are made, now all I have to do is go through and color balance and adjust some exposure, and everything will be wonderful. Meantime, here are these, which have been sitting on my hard drive for a week, waiting for me to have a working display again. There's a long saga involved, but I really don't feel like going into my broken laptop problems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0021.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0022.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/weekbefore/0024.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>still catching up...</title>
          <description>This is all from last wednesday... so I'm only a week behind now... really the problem is me. I have everything I've shot up to yesterday edited and ready to post, but I'm lazy or reluctant to post everything all at once or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Soccer field very early/very late the night before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/donwannagohome/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Kamp's, which is technically not a club, since they're sketchy like that. But they did have free pbr until 11 that night, which led to a lot of the further madness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/donwannagohome/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;OKC's newest sport, synchronized drinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/donwannagohome/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/donwannagohome/0004.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;I don't really know who this is, i mean I remember taking the picture and introducing myself, but anyway I'm kinda in love with this, ok?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/donwannagohome/0005.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Hat fight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/donwannagohome/0006.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>wow I'm way behind....</title>
          <description>blame it on the busted macbook (parts are on their way from hong kong, and we all know how long it takes a slow boat from china to get here...) or blame it on being bummed about not getting the magazine job I thought I was a shoe-in for, or, well, general laziness, but anyway, here are some pics from sunday before last, more shooting for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenakedsun.com&quot;&gt;naked sun&lt;/a&gt;, which is still in progress and might actually be the saving of us all, if by us all I mean media/art people that would like to make money and keep on doing our thing at the same time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nakedsunouttakes/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nakedsunouttakes/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nakedsunouttakes/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nakedsunouttakes/0004.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>last of the saturday photos, and a weird thing that just happened</title>
          <description>&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This dude's name was Izzy. I think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0023.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was just riding my bike around, the middle of the night being the best time for it, and I happened to turn down in to a neighborhood. I thought maybe there would be a way through to the next block, and sometimes there are even people out on their porches, partying, and that's always good for a drink or two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This chick put on an awesome impromptu set. I'd listen to her again, even buy a cd, if I knew who she was of if she had recordings. Anybody know? edit to add: several people have told me that this is Ali harter. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0024.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't have been more wrong. I mean, the neighborhood was all dead end cul de sacs and turned in on itself- the way I came in was the only way in or out. It was &lt;span &gt;quiet&lt;/span&gt;, too. Like zombie movie quiet, all the houses dark, not even a television flickering that I saw. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Ed and Victoria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0025.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept cruising, slowly, looking for some sign of life. I was about to give up and leave the neighborhood, and three big dogs jumped out of their doghouse, running and barking. Then, I saw the fence between me and them, and pressed down the little panic reflex. Not wanting to push my luck, I got the hell out of that weird neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Katie, no metal face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0026.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found five dollars. (Not really, but Alex told me to say that when I tell a story that has no real point, so people don't feel cheated for reading it). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I think he name is Meg? (edit: jennifer. not even close there, bub. ther real question: where do I know a meg zinkly?). Cool chick, does good designs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0027.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>Plaza district fest part 2</title>
          <description>I'm not sure what the theme or the unifying whatever was for this street fest, but I think it might have been &quot;Mess with the drunks,&quot; viz:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0012.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the dragon chased Victoria and Beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0013.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0014.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Tim, we need to talk.

          <title>Plaza district fest part 1</title>
          <description>I'm splitting these into multiple parts, because I think they'll work better that way, and because I say so. Nyah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;hangin' out on the roof deck at Victoria's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;LOW-ANGLE SHOTS ARE COOLER AT 18MM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Creepiest Halloween decoration I';ve seen so far this year.

First, the ubiquitous dad with a kid on his shoulder:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/plazadistfest/0005.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Homies.

          <title>being lost</title>
          <description>Yesterday or the day before, sunday, anyway, I was driving down the highway and I had this sudden feeling of disconnectedness, of being lost. Like when in the night you wake up and don't know where you are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was coming around a curve, and it was raining, cloudy, but I know that section of road, have driven it many times. There's the normal state of having been somewhere, and you remember, for example, that the bathroom is behind you and your car is out in the parking lot or driveway, and that the roads that led you there also lead to home. It's a grounded feeling, a feeling that lets you ignore parts of the landscape that aren't normal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a brief second, coming around that curve, it was like all those connections, where I was going and where I was coming from, and everything that I knew the location of, all of that was cut off, and it was as if I was floating above it. It's so odd because I normally have a very good sense of the space I'm in and what is around me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I looked around I saw every detail of everything, blades of grass and tree branches, and the cars a quarter mile back, and the shapes of the clouds, and then, gradually, over a period of ten seconds, the feeling faded, and while I didn't feel really normal for a couple minutes, the hyper-awareness was gone and the highway was just highway, and the sky was just sky, and the weirdness went away, just like it does when you turn on the light in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, now back to your regularly scheduled blog. There's some nice pics from plaza fest and outtakes from the naked sun shoot coming up, so stay tuned. </description>

          <title>Throw Your Voice</title>
          <description>All of these need captions, but instead of me writing them, you should pull out a sharpie and write them in in the whitespace between the pictures. No, not really. Seriously though, the conference was really fun, I learned a lot about podcasting and a little about blogging. Breakfast from prairie thunder, coffee from cafe evoke and lunch from iguana, all wonderful. It was nice to meet everyone, and hopefully you all like the photos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0004.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0005.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0006.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0007.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0008.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0009.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0010.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0011.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0012.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0013.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0014.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0015.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/throwyourvoice/0016.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>Some opolis show or something</title>
          <description>Friday was fun as shit. Definitely the best night out I've had in a while that didn't involve getting far too drunk. Actually, there was drinking, of course. But the funness was from the dancing and the company, Amber and Kat and some of their friends, oh yeah, and I saw Grizzly Bear's tour bus.  At least, that's what someone said it was. No idea who these bands were, forgot their names already, go to the opolis web site and look i9f you care, but they honestly weren't that great, or I would have written the names down or shot the poster or something. But the night as a whole was a blast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Ghost Bike:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0004.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This guy sucked. Took forever to start and then played bad music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0005.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Amber looks all evil. But I'll give her the benefit of the doubt because she's the whole reason I was down there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0006.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;These guys strike me as the kind of music that's enjoyable right now, but we'll be embarrassed about in a couple years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0007.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0008.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Dancing at La Luna.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0009.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Showed chelsea this, and said, what do you think of it, and she said, it's a good picture but her boobs look hexagonal. So, sorry Amber. Next time I'll try to make you not look evil and hexagonal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/amandaopolis/0010.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>Deluxe Craft Weekend</title>
          <description>Well, samples from the half hour that I was there. It seemed like a really fun time, and if I hadn't been sleep depping and working and whatnot this weekend, I probably would have really enjoyed doing some classes and just sitting around kibitzing with everyone. I could have gotten some of my bookbinding experiments done maybe. Anyway, photos: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>The Opposite Signs... another band post...</title>
          <description>I swear I'm not turning into &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeremycharles.com&quot;&gt;Jeremy Charles&lt;/a&gt;, or worse, Annie Leibowitz, but I do seem to be shooting a lot of musicians lately. This band I didn't really like. The sound was super mellow, smooth jazz like, and it really did nothing for me. There were some good moments, when it seemed like a song would break out and do something interesting, but then it got drowned in the hopeless drone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sleepdepweekend/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Romantic Disaster at HiLo</title>
          <description>Romantic disaster is a local band that's doing amazing things. They've got a great sound and a great look, the kind that even comes through when they're all wasted and playing a quick set at an AIDS benefit show at a dive like the HiLo. In fact, it probably added to the rawness and unpredictability of the whole thing. Of course, your humble blogger was drunk off his ass, so maybe I was just responding to the visceral loudness and hotness of their lead singer. But I've heard them play before, when I was sober and so were they, and they're good. Put them on your list of bands to catch, and then someday, you can be like, &quot;I saw them in this tiny ass club in OKC. The bassist used to make my pizza.&quot; Oh wait, that's me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

Also, romantic disaster was there, photos and review to come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/romanticdisaster/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Norman Bike against Hunger Alleycat</title>
          <description>Not much to say except Ken deserves mad props for putting together the whole bike against hunger series... and to everyone else who organized, Pearl, Stewart, Isiah, and whoever else I'm forgetting, thanks you guys for putting together an awesome set of events; every one I went to was a good time. Now, photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0025.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0026.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0027.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0028.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0029.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0030.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0031.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0032.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0033.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0034.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0035.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0036.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;And last but not least, a sunset.

          <title>state fair photos</title>
          <description>So I went to the fair saturday night.... insanity. The only time I see this many people in one place is when I'm not in oklahoma. But a fun time too, I got my annual fair lemonade and saw the slap chop guy (look at my twitpic, I'm too lazy to repost that one). By the way, can you tell I love my new wide angle way too much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0021.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0022.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Katie, Erin, and some other people I only half know on the Fireball ride. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0023.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Also, Tommy and Deepak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0024.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, back to room cleaning.</description>

          <title>what? 300 posts!</title>
          <description>Yeah, I'm as shocked as you are. Some of those are drafts that were never published, but still... a year and a half and three hundred posts later, we're still here. Wow. This one sort of snuck up me. It seems like just a couple weeks ago I had the 250th post. But no. Anyway, some random photos before we get to fair stuff and bike race later today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;I don't have enough superlatives for the meal I had at Musashi's last thursday. The show was fun, but the kobe beef there is tied for the best steak I've ever had. The fried rice was also really good. I like places that pay attention to their staples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Yeah, ooh, pretty fire. Thanks to Lori for letting me show her a good time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Completely unrelated: Justin and Miranda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/allatonce/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Little creepy there Justin.

          <title>Opolis show</title>
          <description>Went down to norman with Chelsea (and now she has a twitter so I can link that: &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/thenakedsun&quot;&gt;@thenakedsun&lt;/a&gt;) and took photos of the band &quot;Deer People&quot; (or is that &quot;The Deer People&quot;?) and anyway, hated the photos when I first looked, but really these aren't that bad. There's a second band down there, Mayola, they were good too. Louder and more energetic, but a lot simpler musically. I liked both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;On the way to Norman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0024.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Oh yeah, there were random firedancers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0025.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;And then the sky opened up. And it rained a lot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0026.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Like, really a lot, even for a place where the rain has been going for two weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0027.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there were the bands. I was there covering Deer People, so naturally I have a lot of pictures of them. Here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0028.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0029.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0030.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0031.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0032.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0033.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0034.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0035.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0036.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0037.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0038.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0039.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0040.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0041.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0042.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0043.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Saw this between bands backstage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0044.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Mayola rocked out a short set... I don't know about you, but sometimes really high energy three-chord rock is what the doctor ordered.

          <title>for the haters</title>
          <description>&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0053.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been showing the draft or proof copy of the book around, and there have been some comments made about my selection of images. I'm only going to say this once, so read carefully:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0054.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0055.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't pick the pictures for whatever reason you're thinking. This book is the result of 5 different edits, three of which were complete restarts from the original 25,000 pictures. It took me 6 months to get this far, a herculean task if there ever was one, so you really won't ever get the full reasoning behind what is in the book. Photographers and picture editors reading this, if you've ever had a 25,000 picture project all in your head, will understand what I'm talking about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0056.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0057.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons I put pictures in the book: either they told a part of the story, I thought they were a good picture, or more usually, both. Of the individual portraits, I tried not to have more than two or three of anybody, and I think I did that... but there are also pictures that are more about the things that are happening, and I didn't really think about who was in those at all. Except I did, kinda. The second edit featured a couple of people more prominently, and I actually trashed that one because I didn't like the way it felt with those people at the front. It's not about any one person, or any three, but about an indefinite number somewhere between 20 and 50, about what you can fit into a two bedroom apartment for a decent party. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0058.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0059.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I think I'm going to go back and write little vignettes about the pictures... not captions, but stories to go with them. Not for all of them, but for some of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0060.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0061.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note for these photos: they're all from last wednesday, there's more coming, a lot more, I have an infinite backlog right now actually. Too much other stuff going on to post, but I'm trying now. There was an unintentional hiatus while I was sick and an intentional one the past couple days, but I'm officially back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0062.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/goingbackwards/0063.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Norman Playground</title>
          <description>So to put a capper on an unbelievably amazing day, we went down to norman, where Amber and her fiancee Josh fed us cake and roast and squash. Even the squash was good, and I've never like it in the past. Might have to revise that sentiment now. Anyway, we watched a movie, something weird with Zooey Deschanel and some dude adopting a baby from china.Weird ending, but I think I liked it. Then we all went to the park, where it was very dark. Too dark to focus using normal methods; zen methods were employed with some success. As sharp as can be, considering 1/10th of a second at f/1.2 and ISO 25000. You don't believe me, you go out and try it. Anyway, pictures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0022.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Chelsea took this one, she said I needed pics of myself on my birthday. Here's me playing on a playground at 25 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0023.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;And here's the playground, also by her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Amber, looking at Josh in the foreground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0026.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>25th Birthday, photoshoot, awesomeness</title>
          <description>Basically last sunday was one of the best days I've ever had, right up there with my 20th birthday, the day I graduated high school, and the field day at summer arts' institute. Might even be the best, what with all the excellent madness and amazing people and things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up and went home, had a good breakfast with the family, eggs, home fries, bacon, the kind of meal you dream of later. Then I coordinated with Chelsea and Meaghan for the shoot later that day (don't cheat, there's tons of story before we get to those pictures). We were going to go to Stillwater and make a big production, but Maeghan had cut her foot badly the night before. She didn't want to cancel, so I suggested we scale back, just do one of the ideas and do it here in the city. So we did, and chelsea came down and met us at Sauced. Cyrus showed up on his motorbike (dubbed the aluminum falcon because it's also a piece of crap) and said hello and whatnot, and then jetted, and so did we. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found a place to do the painting, over at Grant (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/schofield&quot;&gt;@schofield&lt;/a&gt;) and Damaris' (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/somna&quot;&gt;@somna&lt;/a&gt;) house, but they weren't going to be home, so we went in search of coffee, and failed. What we did find, Sara Sara, was downright creepy. But their cupcakes were decent and the milk bar was brilliant. They need to work on their coffee offerings though. Real espresso would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I waited, while Maeghan did the work and Chelsea sat very still. This is what the waiting was like: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now add to that 20 mosquito bites, and I decided to go inside to wait. This is what the girls were up to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And later: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, on location, swatting a bee: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the final silhouette: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/moremore/0021.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's another picture up at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenakedsun.com&quot;&gt;The Naked Sun&lt;/a&gt; our literary journal. That's right, I said &quot;our&quot;- I'm one of the editors and web designer, and if everybody is half as cool as then seem, and can manage to meet deadlines, we're going to be the raddest thing out there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the shoot, we dropped Maeghan off to go get her foot checked out, and headed to Norman for cake and more adventures. Tune in in a coupla hours, and there'll be more pics.</description>

          <description>Monday rolls around and I'm looking for polaroid film when who should call me but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.furburger.org&quot;&gt;Christa May&lt;/a&gt;, wondering if I'm down for a little libation at Mcnellie's. Of course I am. I'm always down for Mcnellie's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Logan and Matt, not me, but Christa's new dude. Isn't it nice how everyone seems to be forming couples at the same time? Or at least several of my friends have over the past few weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Matt by himself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm posting all three of these because I can't remember which she liked and I think they all look pretty decent. #3 is the best, but who am I to judge? Oh yeah, that's my job. So yeah, just ignore the first two, those are just for Christa. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mondaycmay/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Location, Location</title>
          <description>Sunday was location scouting. And thrift stores. And a nondisclosure agreement, so I'm not sure what I can and can't say, but none of these are embargoed, formally or informally, so there you have it. We're working on cool shit, and when it comes out it's going to be really rad, but that's not for four months or so, so expect teasers and hints and nothing substantive until at least january.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Credit where credit is due: photo by Chelsea M'lynn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/locationscouting/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Sherree Chamberlain</title>
          <description>This is the band and the singer/songwriter that the crew that I was there to photograph was there to film. Wait, let me rephrase. I showed up and my friend Tomee was there with a film crew to record Sherree and her band, and Tomee asked me if I would shoot some production stills, so I did. And I got backstage access for the whole show, and some nice pictures; My friend and fellow photographer &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeremycharles.com&quot;&gt;Jeremy Charles&lt;/a&gt; said something on twitter about the joy of the performer being why he does concert photography, and I saw what he meant shooting these pictures. I shouldn't be surprised that he also has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeremycharles.com/blog/index.php/2009/05/27/sherree-chamberlain-photos/&quot;&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt; of photos of Chamberlain too. Dude knows what's up. Girl can sing and entertain and has the look too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sherreechamberlin/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Random friends</title>
          <description>Hopefully I can be forgiven for sandwiching these photos of some friends I ran into at the concert in between band posts... these are cool people, as far as I know. I mean, I'm not their mother, so I can't be a character witness, but at least they knew where the cool show was in stillwater that night and made it out, so that says something. And some of them, the ones I know better, are verified badass. So, guilt by association with me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/concertfriends/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/concertfriends/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/concertfriends/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Uglysuit</title>
          <description>So last saturday and sunday I was in stillwater for various reasons including location scouting and &quot;for the hell of it.&quot; I rolled out of OKC at 9pm, right after work, and rolled into stillwater at around 10, rolling right up to a show and betting an assignment for production stills in the first five minutes of being there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I'm getting out of the car and combobulating myself (grabbing my camera and checking the settings and making sure I have an extra battery and card) and I hear the band that's playing, don't know who it is, but they sound good. Then I walk in and recognize Uglysuit on stage. Fucking good show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/uglysuitstillwater/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>One picture</title>
          <description>There's a story in news-photographer apocrypha about an old school photographer who went out on assignment to someplace very remote; say, China. Mongolia. Now this guy was old school to our old school; learned to photograph with a 4x5 and knew a time when lens caps doubled as shutters. He went to China with a new nikon 35mm and when he got back, as he was deplaning, an assistant for whatever paper he was working for met him just off the plane to rush his film to the lab. He pulls out his camera, rewinds the roll that's inside, and hands it to the assistant, saying &quot;Print 'em both, kid.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I'm not a fan of the slow, patient photography that this implies; neither am I a proponent of going out to an event and overheating a motor drive taking way too many pictures. I like to take a series of pictures that tells the story over time. But there is something to be said for being patient, and taking less pictures. The night I took this photo, I took two; this one and one of the inside of my bag as I was putting the camera away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/onepic/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to go and edit the pictures from the next night, where I shot 500 pictures in a couple hours. There's a lot going on here at matt mills world HQ, so stay tuned.</description>

          <title>Code for a Cause comes to CoCo</title>
          <description>So saturday was a busy day, spent mostly recovering from friday in the morning, but I did manage to stop by the &lt;a href=&quot;www.okccoco.com&quot;&gt;CoCo&lt;/a&gt; for a minute to snap a few pictures of code for a cause, a really neat charity that provieds web site makeovers for nonprofits. 600 hours of web design and coding all compressed into one day. Pretty awesome. Wish I could have stayed longer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cfac/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Big Truck Tacos</title>
          <description>So, back when I was trying to start a city blog for okc, and at the same time still blogging here and doing my best imitation of a fish's drinking habits, I had a series that would have been titled &quot;I love it here&quot;- reviews of good shit here in OKC that would have been a regular feature if the blog had had more than three readers. Shows you how good I am at promotion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The inside of the place is nicely decorated, with good seating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bigtruck/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a couple steak al carbon tacos, a mexican coke, and chips and salsa. The tacos were good, not too greasy, with corn tortillas and onions for flavor. About that flavor: I wish I could say it was on par with other places I've had tacos locally, (I'm looking at you, Iguana, with all your deliciousness) but there just wasn't enough. All I got was beef and onion, no spice. That said, they were good, and with the salsa, not bad at all. The chips and salsa were chips and salsa, good and fresh. A word on Mexican Coke: you should try it. They use real cane sugar to make it, which has a better flavor than high fructose bullshit. Really better than what you get out of the fountain. I think I paid 9 bucks for the meal, and I was pretty satisfied when I was done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Any place with patio seating is a win in this town. We Okies like to dine al fresco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bigtruck/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Big Truck Tacos would have been a natural fit for that series. They're a locally owned newish place, right in the middle of the part of 23rd street that I was betting would see development 6 months ago... and here we are, already a new restaurant. And they're good. Great patio seating, nice atmos inside, fast service, friendly staff, and that awesome location,  they've got all the stuff they need lined up to be a success. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Not a food photographer. But doesn't this look good? Needs more seasoning to be perfect, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bigtruck/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended, and you'll probably see me there trying out more menu items as the weeks progress.</description>

          <title>My afterparty Shots</title>
          <description>So yeah, despite having my camera stolen (borrowed, I guess) I did manage to take a ton of photos myself at that party. Yeah, I know, more drunk people. but they look &lt;span &gt;good&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0025.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0026.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0027.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0028.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0029.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0030.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0031.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0032.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0033.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0034.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0035.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0036.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0037.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>The Morning After</title>
          <description>This is the last of the pics from last weekend. Man, that was epic. I'm basically doing two jobs, but only getting paid for one; I'm a lowly barista, and I'm a photographer, shooting all the time and editing when I can, around my social and work schedule. It's actually pretty fun, I just don't sleep a lot these days. Never did sleep much though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That morning, though, I woke up and felt fine; six whole hours of sleep does wonders, even when there's half a bottle of rum involved. then we did brunch at Cafe do Brasil. They really have the best sunday brunch, and my favorite chorizo in town. Then onto sauced to hang out on the patio and soak up the sun on a gorgeous day. A fantastic end to a really great weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Chelsea stretching. I love the lines in this one; odd parallels you don't expect take a second to resolve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0038.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Again with Chelsea. Did I mention she's also gorgeous? Yeah. Now I have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0039.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Pearl looking all stoic and really not hungover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0040.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This puppy was cute as hell. And obviously sent by the devil to enslave us all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0041.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;See?

          <title>MYL Chelsea's After Party Photos</title>
          <description>I first met &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0033.jpg&quot;&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; at the bike prom on friday- she seemed interesting in a &quot;you're a person with interesting ideas&quot; kind of way, then she showed up here in the city for Made You Look and the afterparty, and turns out we're into a lot of the same things, photography and journalism and documentary work, and we're getting along famously at the party when she asks to see my camera, and I hand it over (this is after several stout rum and cokes, mind), and she runs off taking pictures like there's no tomorrow. And I don't know, something about the way I can see she's concentrating, I let her keep going with it for a while. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm really glad I did because she's really good. Focus is on the money, compositionally interesting, good moments, the whole bit. I asked her later, after seeing the pictures, if she had any experience. &quot;I just shoot everything I love. Always have,&quot; she tells me. And that's exactly it folks, what I've been saying for years: shoot what you love, the rest is just technicalities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0021.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0022.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0023.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0024.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <description>First off, a video: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;358&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6277295&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6277295&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;358&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/6277295&quot;&gt;B Boy Sequence II&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user932074&quot;&gt;Matt Mills&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, just a few stills not in that sequence. The battle was decent, but I missed most of it, jumped up on stage with Chelsea (who you'll be hearing a lot more about in a little bit) and squeezed a spot with a view of the dance floor. Kicked some dudes bag out of the way. It was good to see the little part that I saw; the show was so small this year I wondered why they bothered. The art was all pretty decent, but nothing stuck with me. There should have been more, in more space. Bricktown wasn;t the place to have it, people. Anyway, photos: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/madeyoulookandafter/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up next will be photos of the afterparty, which was way more epic.</description>

          <title>BIKE PROM</title>
          <description>I was going to be all cool and separate thes out into three or four posts, but I realized there's no reason to do that, because I've got a ton more posts coming, including a review of big truck tacos, some fliks from made you look 09, and crazy sunday with puppies. So, without further delay, bikeprom (and yes, I'm being lazy by not adding captions, but most of these are self explanatory):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bikeprom/0001.jpg&quot;

          <title>driving around</title>
          <description>I'm at a loss for subjects that aren't drunk people and aren't boring. This is all I've been able to come up with in the last couple days. Oh yeah, and some of sober people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Nighttime, trying to get pictures of lightning. At least the signs look cool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drivingaround/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;So there was a fire, and I drove around it trying to get closer, this is all I could do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drivingaround/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drivingaround/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drivingaround/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Not my shoes; issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drivingaround/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <description>These are from a random party last week; I'm still working through the backlog. I'll probably post everything else sometime tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Ran to the bar for shots, 'cause there was only 3.2 beers at the party.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0015.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0016.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Christa and KW- It was cool to see him out, even randomly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0018.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0019.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;The dude on the right was leaving the country (or was it his birthday?); it was his party, anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0021.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>beginning at the beginning</title>
          <description>So I have a huge pile of photos from the last week, and I've been procrastinating on posting them because of work and lazyness and such, but here, finally, on a coffee fueled sunday night, I've gotten them all out and will post them in blog-sized chunks until I get bored with them and post all the rest in a large-ish post sometime on tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Mom on her first day as a retiree. Lunch at Olive Garden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;This dude was sort of bewildered at the camera. Also, he took the next photo, of Christa and me. Bewildered by focus as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Yeah, that's me. A sight rarely seen on the internets, although there are really far too many pics of me out there at this point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Cmay in her natural habitat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Lambo outside of work. Did I mention I work at a nice place? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pcsunday/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Another Norman Saturday Night</title>
          <description>I felt kinda really off shooting saturday, ended up dancing as much as photographing. That's what I get for eating a whole hot n ready sausage pizza. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This girl had everything I look for in a woman: 1. a camera 2. madness 3. the tendency to flip shit and run off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/anothernormansat/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Cameron, also late of BROQUEST, although he finished in a different place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/anothernormansat/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This was a complete accident. I like it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/anothernormansat/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This was completely on purpose.

It's funny how few pictures I have of scenes like this, when it happens to me all the time. Expect that to change in the weeks to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/anothernormansat/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Booze Cruise Meets BROQUEST</title>
          <description>Or at least one of the members of BROQUEST was there. All in all, a fun night. I keep hearing that other people are doing booze cruise on saturdays now, if that's true could someone tell me? Chris? I just want to drink and ride bikes with people, and who cares what night it's on, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, between last week's illness, starting the new job, and all the things I was doing over the weekend, I've been neglecting all the backend stuff- editing, organizing, and blogging. It's tiring, and the list of things I need to get done tomorrow is a mile and a half long. May or may not do all/some of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bcstuart/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Technical difficulties...</title>
          <description>For those of you paying attention, there has been a little hiatus, a delay, a mini vacation even... Partly because of work, and the interruption to my sleep schedule, but also partly because it seems like I pick up every little bug that comes along since my accident. I felt like death for 48 hours, and I still have something of a sore throat, but I think I'm going to be all right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pics are from Monday; Lori texted me from work, asking me to get people up there, so I did; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.furburger.org&quot;&gt;Christa&lt;/a&gt; and Jonathan came out and had drinks. It's sort of a hellish job, working in a karaoke bar; I hope Lori gets something else soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like my new job so far. It's actually challenging to steam milk. I still don't really have a grasp of what I'm really doing, but that will come in time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those of you that have read this far down, a surprise: Booze cruise is happening this Friday, 9pm. The plan is to do two rounds at each bar, so we can keep some kind of momentum. Starting at the rooster, have a couple pitchers, then to the drunken fry, because I really want to try that truffle shit, and then to nancy's, so we can all get banned from yet another karaoke bar. I'm going to be annoying everyone in my phone/twitter followers about this too for the next couple days, hopefully enough people come out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nancysmonday/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>ISO 25,000</title>
          <description>So this is crazy, really wild, I mean, talk about no light, some of these are taken in the reflected mirror ball light off a black wall, just insanely no light at all, but here are the pictures. This is going to be fun. I'm playing around at ISO 25k, which is just unheard of, it's so noisy it's an extra level of abstraction. Focus is &quot;guess and get lucky sometimes,&quot; other times it's just blurry and that doesn't really hurt things because these pictures aren't about detail but about energy and tone and exploring places that heretofore were invisible to the camera, and a lot of times to the eye. These are places people go but not places that are easily seen unless you go there, at least until now. Enough ramble. The photos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/ISO25K/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Make-a-wish Has a Rock Show</title>
          <description>Sometime Last week I found out that some of my friends from highschool were doing a benefit show for Make-a-Wish Foundation, and they needed a photographer. So, I ent and shot a few things, didn't stay the whole night. The first band was really shitty, the same three chords, all at the same tempo, and the same one note drone from the lead singer for every song. It was boring and shitty. then Hundresomethings came on, and well, they were better. They still lack a little edge, I don't know what they need, but it's not bad to hear live. Then I had to go. The good news: they raised over $2k last night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/makeawish/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/makeawish/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/makeawish/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/makeawish/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/makeawish/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/makeawish/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/makeawish/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>OKCCOCO has an artshow</title>
          <description>Lots of good stuff. Somehow I didn't shoot any of Kanaly's work, but he had some up as well. Anyway, Last night was crazy and photo filled, I've got two more posts in the pipeline for tonight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cocoart/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cocoart/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cocoart/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cocoart/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cocoart/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Why magnum needs a blog</title>
          <description>Ok, so go read &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.magnumphotos.com/2009/07/the_future_of_the_magnum_blog.html&quot;&gt;this statement from Magnum Photo's blog&lt;/a&gt;. The gist of it is, they aren't blogging for the foreseeable future, and might not blog ever again. The reason they give is that blogs aren't a good platform for quality content. It's offensive and wrong-headed, to say the least. Even if/when they do come back, if it's as several blogs or as one feed, if the focus becomes more about dialogue than content, I think they're missing something big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedela/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say that blogs aren't a good place for quality content is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/&quot;&gt;ignorant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americansuburbx.com/&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://curatedby.jon-kyle.com/&quot;&gt;misinformed&lt;/a&gt;. (Links go to rebuttal examples.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.burnmagazine.org/&quot;&gt;Also this&lt;/a&gt;). Those are all blogs, all that I've come across recently; there are countless sources of good content on the web, places that have really brilliant content, displayed well. The last one is a community effort, and in fact arose because of a group of people looking for a place. So, to shut down a blog to build a community seems silly. Why not blog the process of making the new site?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedela/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why aren't the photographers of Magnum, surely some of the world's finest visual storytellers, blogging themselves? (With the notable exception of David Allen Harvey, who runs Burn magazine, of course). It'd be the best group blog ever, if they would embrace a little technology; the best eyes in the world, reporting daily what they see. From the perspective of one who does it, who has done it now for going on two years (with a little hiatus between the end of the santa fe blog and the start of this one), it's not hard at all to knock out a blog post a day, sometimes two or three. Especially if all it consists of are photos with captions. Every other day is even easier; even when I was working full time at a job that had nothing to do with my photography, I still did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedela/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess part of the problem is that to get a group of photographers to do anything together is something like herding cats; if you've ever walked in a city with even four or five of us you know what I'm talking about; it takes two or three times as long to get somewhere (even dinner) because the whole group sort of wanders off after a picture, and then the rest have to wait, and by the time the one gets back someone else has wandered off. Now imagine a group like that, all self-interested, agreeing to do something like a group blog, to share space on the web with anyone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedela/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking that way is really wrong-headed. Separate channels for each photographer presume that each one is doing enough to hold a reader's interest indefinitely, and that readers of one photographer won't be interested in others. It's silly. The truth is, group blogs of like minded people (or at least people who are all talking about the same things) usually have more readers and better content than single author blogs. Think &lt;a href=&quot;http://laist.com/&quot;&gt;LAist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/&quot;&gt;BoingBoing&lt;/a&gt;, or blogs like that. The rising tide lifts all boats. And, because there are other people out there doing the same thing in the same space, you're apt to learn and improve your own content as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedela/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, nobody listens to me, or at least nobody at Magnum.</description>

          <title>Photography as a New Liberal Art</title>
          <description>This is not a post about taking photographs, but about looking at them, reading them, and understanding what they are and are not. If you want to know about taking photos, there's a ton of good literature out there. There is a whole subset of phototographers who think that the techniques of photography (exposure, sharpness, depth, grain/noise, etc) are an end unto themselves, but this is a false path. But the fact that they exist and are there to tell us what the rules are so we can break them effectively is a good thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of &quot;New Liberal Arts&quot; comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://snarkmarket.com/&quot;&gt;Snarkmarket&lt;/a&gt; and their interesting if incomplete book &lt;a href=&quot;http://snarkmarket.com/nla/&quot;&gt;New Liberal Arts&lt;/a&gt;, which is based around the idea that to function intelligently in society today, there is a new skillset outside of the traditional lines of the liberal arts. The main point of learning liberal arts is to learn how to think critically about the world.  Since it's my area, and since the chapter in the book is one of the areas that comes up short, I thought some expansion was called for in the area of thinking critically about photographs. These are all just starting points, ideas, and not rules forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first most important consideration when looking at a photograph is the content of the picture. A photo is a two-d simulacra of the 4-d world; It takes a cone of space (the angle of view) and a slice of time (the shutter speed) and reduces that to an image on a piece of paper, or more commonly now, a screen. There are parts in and out of focus, there is a limit to the detail that can be seen (and no software, no matter what CSI tells you, can bring back detail from a pixelated image). There is a perspective, and by this I mean a camera position, high or low, close to the subject or far away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this mean to us, the viewer? Any rendering of a scene is only a partial rendering; at any given time there are an infinite number of perspectives and the same infinite gradation of moments that the camera can have, and we are seeing only one. I am categorically opposed to the idea that all of these perspectives are equal (relativism be damned, it's solipsism with a coat of postmodern paint). Some moments are better than others, and if that weren't the case, there would be no art in photography. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A photo can be evidence, it can tell a (short) story, but through selection of moments and perspectives, the photograph can tell a lie, too. It is impossible to tell by looking at a photograph if it is true or false. The only thing that can be determined is if it has been altered after the fact. This is why people are always so aghast when someone is caught photoshopping news pictures, because it disturbs their questionable belief in the veracity of the medium of photography. It's a religious belief, one which has no grounding in fact; you'd see similar responses if you went in front of a church congregation and gave them a logical proof of atheism (ask a Jesuit, they really do exist, but reality is not wholly logical anyway). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a photo can't be true or false from the perspective of a viewer, and here I'm only talking of candid pictures, not staged or manipulated after the fact. I can walk into a party and make 300 pictures, and just in the selection of what to show, make it look like the best party ever or the worst time anybody has ever had outside of torture chambers. Neither is true. Or they both might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, that's all the lesson I have in me today. The important takeaway: a photo is never the whole story. Sometimes it's enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/dfest09/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>booze cruise: the return</title>
          <description>So last night was the first booze cruise I've been to in months... between time off the bike and booze cruise itself kind of dying out, it just hasn't happened. I don't know about anybody else, but a week doesn't seem complete without riding my bike around on a friday night and getting smashed. So I did. Unfortunately, the night was ruined at the end, the second or third stolen purse at blue note. Sucks. The photos weren't all that great, I wasn't really focused, but as always, there are a few cool things. Anyway, next up is a post from barcamp okc, which is going on right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Casey at rooster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newbc/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Faye terrorizing Ken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/newbc/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Faye and M____, who's name I should remember, but I don't.

          <title>starbux is giving away pastries</title>
          <description>And I'm not drawn in by their evil conspiracy. It's taken years, but now they're finally making a move. Wake up, Sheeple! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(At least one person reading this will get the joke. The rest of you, don't worry, I'm not any more unhinged than I ever was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm writing this from my restored and much loved macbook. Friday night, before I went out to shoot these pictures, I was leaning over my desk to grab my bike off of the wall, and I knocked over a 16oz cup of coffee right into the computer. I knew there was nothing I could really do then; the best thing to do is let it dry first. So I did, I went off to the party, had a good time, (moar hellkats=more good times), and rode home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day, I tried to restart it, no dice, so I opened it up and there was a ton of gunk on everything, of course. Coffee+2.5yrs of dust, pretty much. Disheartened, I gave up and went to Mcnellies to be attacked by the photographer from lookatOKC. No, I don't want my picture taken. No, I won't sign a release. Go talk to the wedding party. It's my own fault for wearing my houndstooth fedora; that thing draws attention like whoa. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paperazzi deflected (yeah, I'm aware of the irony, but at least I know the people I take pictures of), I went home, and little elves hadn't come in and fixed my laptop, so the next day (sunday), I started dousing it with alcohol, and then I had the bright idea to get out a toothbrush and scrub away the crud. I let it dry overnight, plugged everything together, and it worked on the first try. Go me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also: the more I use my new camera, the more I love it. I've already shot 2000 photos with it. ok, fine, I'll shut up about it already. But the good news keeps on coming, I have a job interview tomorrow, I fixed this laptop, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rideoutandback/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <description>It's too early and I haven't had my coffee.

          <title>No, you can't tawe my picture</title>
          <description>dear lookatokc photographer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, you can't take my picture. Yes, I'm also a working photographer (for a given value of working), no, that doesn't mean we really have anything in common. You take party pics, i take pictures of my friends at parties. You use a flash when you don't need it, I hate it even when I absolutely have to use it. You have a huge camera bag weighing you down with shit you don't need, I only own two lenses. All of these are strikes against you, but really, it's just that I don't like having my picture taken. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of us don't want to be in the paper. I might be the only one, but I'd wager there are at least a few people out there who like anonymity. Or who need it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly there's little value in party pics, hell, I take thousands myself and put them on this shitty blog, but the big difference is that I know the people that I take pictures of, for the most part. I feel weird not knowing people and taking their picture. It's knowing the people that lets me get closer, get a little more meaning in the phototographs than the standard grin and grab-the-person-next-to-you. Some of them, at least (yes, there are a few posed pics here on the blog and more on my facebook, but those are here for the people in them, not for me to show off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>post #250!</title>
          <description>Never though this blog would make it this long. But then I also thought I'd be long gone from oklahoma too. Anyway, It's been an interesting four days, to say the least. I got my new camera on wednesday, and I couldn't be happier with it. The D700 is an amazing machine; it makes everything that I do easier and pushes the realm of photographic possibility farther than I'd thought possible. Yeah, it's that good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my first delay; I was having too much fun with the new camera to blog. Then the power went out in my neighborhood overnight, and there was no internet; then, finally, just as I got these photos edited, i spilled a coffee into my macbook, ruining it. so now they're re-edited, and here for your enjoyment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next post: look for the gratuitous cat photos (not what you think). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0004.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0005.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstd700/0006.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>larry and his flask</title>
          <description>This band, Larry and his flask, is a crazy high energy bluegrass punk band. Good sound, but I didn't stay for the second set. I don't know, the blugrass part of their sound got annoying to me, but then I loved them for the first half. Go figure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy with the base, though, I swear he was playing tourette's or something, different instruments every song, running around, throwing his base on the floor and then on a table, just crazy. Entertaining as hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/larryandhisflask/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, new camera's here, I'm playing with and and enjoying the hell out of it.

          <title>Norman B-day's and such</title>
          <description>another round of drinking and photos... this was one of those nights that sort of blurred together towards the end... really fun, though, and I woke up in time to head off the hangover with water. Protip: Water works best before you actually feel the hangover. If you already have a headache, you're going to suffer more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I rode my bike to get down there, 20 miles in 2.3 hours... terrible time, I know, but I did it, and that's the important part. There was a lot of terror and panic, and anger at everything with four wheels, but it's all part of the show at this point. I've just got to recondition myself, and that's going to take time. How long before I can ride ten miles in half an hour again? I don't know, probably a while. How long before I don't flinch every time a car passes is more important, and hopefully that'll be sooner. Pain and fatigue I can deal with, fear is harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less seriously, though, the night was a blast. 2 hours of bike riding to get to 6 hours of party=8 good hours. For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Fabulous shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;B-Bell in classic black and white.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Birthday Girl Shelby.

No, I actually think they were headbutting or something. I did mention that things were blurry for me at the end of the night, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Traci and Casey, now roommates and rhyme-mates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightinnorman/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Incidentally, this is the same guy (mario, I think) who had the shoes.

          <title>sometimes...</title>
          <description>Sometimes all you have to do is get out there and push the button. When there are doubts, when the haters are getting to you, when you worry that you're past prime, never going to amount to anything, that's when you've gotta go out and make pictures. Prime the pump, get those psychomotor cues going. Creating something is the best solution to get out of a funk; there are precious few things better than an unexpectedly good picture. I wasn't expecting much out of these, but I really like 'em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fuck I'm verbose today. Wrote my intro for the OKCITY book too. Might do a limited run(10-20), and publish a pdf for free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;this is what happens when you double tap long exposures- more often than not one or the other will be good. for this one, the second frame was really blurry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bluewed/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;i tried this in black and white, but his eyes really make the picture. I don't think I had a good portrait of him before this either, so it's doubly good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bluewed/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This was going to be titled &quot;the fight,&quot; but I don't know if it comes through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bluewed/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Another eye picture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bluewed/0004.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>Wednesday pool adventure</title>
          <description>So I forgot to post these- edited them, output jpegs, and then forgot to actually upload and blog them. I thought I did, sorry I lied to you cody. My fault. Anyway, these suffer a little bit from being shot at insanely high ISO on a small format camera, so don't judge too harshly. On a related note, I can't wait to get my new camera and really get to shooting again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedpooladv/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Photo Walk</title>
          <description>The 4th was a good night; I ended up sort of all over the place, first riding my bike to a party right on the river in Tulsa, and then catching a ride out to the sticks for a huge bash in a field (this being the 4th, and it being oklahoma, nobody's day is complete without going out into the middle of nowhere and Blowing Shit Up). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get there and there's a $10 cover per head. Then we stand in line for beer for half an hour for 3.2 bud light. Then, just as I'm tweeting about how a fight would be a nice mood lifter, it starts to rain. So, the people who have tents run for them, and the people who don't run for their cars. I'm not lying when I say that I probably had a better time sitting in that car listening to music and talking than I would have getting obliterated and setting fire to the whole party. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we bailed and headed back to Tim's apartment, where everybody just crashed. Which meant that my bike was across downtown from me when I woke up in the morning, so of course, I went to get it. I didn't &lt;span &gt;have to&lt;/span&gt; walk, I could have waited for a ride to pick it up, but the walk appealed to me. And then there were photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0012.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0013.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>oh yeah, I was supposed to post these...</title>
          <description>Yeah, meant to put these up yesterday. Got distracted by Hulu again. &lt;span &gt;Royal Pains&lt;/span&gt; this time. Good thing House is in the off season, or I'd never get anything done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, I went out to Tulsa to take a break and recharge, sort of reset myself. One of the nice effects of travel is you almost always get a fresh look at yourself while trying to look at a new place, even if that new place is only a couple hours away. I'd been feeling a little blocked up creatively and a weekend away from my routine was just what I needed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually fasted this weekend- not in the &quot;not eating at all&quot; sense of the word but in the &quot;staying hungry&quot; sense. One moderate meal a day, the occasional beer, maybe a snack. Whenever I've tried the cold turkey no food approach, I've failed miserably, because I lack the willpower. One meal a day is enough to give you the edge of feeling hungry without making it into this huge task. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About that- the edge of hardship- when things are difficult, sometimes it will make you sharper, quicker, more discerning- you can rise to the situation in a way that, when everything is easy, you couldn't. I've always thought the best art comes out of working around limitations, not when the limitations are removed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fastingweekend/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Midnight photo sesh</title>
          <description>Couple photos... Went to sleep on Timmy &amp; Ali's couch, woke up when Ali got home after the bars, hung out with all these dudes. Tulsa=Coolsville thus far. My team won at trivia, although I don't think I contributed more than one or two answers. Bike Against hunger got some money, and some gift certificates on top of that. Today's adgenda includes a bike shop and finding whole foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alishouse/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alishouse/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alishouse/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>The cookout</title>
          <description>&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After pride, there was this cookout, with a bunch of excellent food. The chef from Cafe 7, which is on the northside somewhere (chime in in the comments if you know where it is). F'ing amazing ziti, pretty good kebabs, pesto crusted grilled chicken, it was nice. Some days I forget to eat until late in the day, and then circumstance prevents it for a couple more hours, and then I'm rewarded for the wait with a meal like that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was really nice, but I wish I had more photos of the whole thing. Like I said, I was having an off day sunday, maybe because of the lack of sustenance. I had to let the hate pass before I could even look at the photos again, that's why I took these sunday and you're just now seeing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I'm several days out from my last cup of coffee. I think that's what I'll go do now. That and get ready for TULSA: THE SEQUAL. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pridecookout/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Pride Parade</title>
          <description>So, it's pride 09. I wasn't on, but these I like. For those who don't know: I'm straight. And I'm not going to lie, this was mostly about being a part of the spectacle and drinking and cooking out for me. But yes, I do support a whole range of gay rights, marriage and equal protection and other things. But this was a party on wheels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to say the big fail is because of the lack of intimacy with the subject(true), or sub-standard camera equipment(not true), but really it was because I lacked two things: focus and a camera strap. I wasn't focused on taking pictures, more on riding the new bike, and I didn't have a strap to hold the camera so I was constantly death gripping it and worried I would drop it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Two days before, but already started at the Copa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The Bike Horde.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This was something about people wearing leather and being gay? Not sure. update from my friend hope who Knows Things: &quot;The picture at the pride parade the people in leather. Its the national leather association. that's what the blue and black flag with the red heart represents. its a BDSM community with a very strong Gay following. I know i always have the strangest information. but there you go.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This really surprised me; Dell is a big company, glad to see that they were out there in support. They have a pretty big call center here in the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The Boneshakers were out, all five of us that are still here and riding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I don't know what to say about the dude on the horse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The crowd at the end was something else. A couple thousand people, easily. All along the route there were spectators, but nothing to make me expect this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/pride09/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>night portraits</title>
          <description>&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I actually took this because I really liked the light, and I wanted to remember it for future studio use. Single, harsh light can be good, even from directly above the subject.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightportraits/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Another &quot;miracle&quot; picture: there's no way to express how little light there is when one of the biggest sources in the picture is a cell phone screen. Of course, there's quite a bit coming off the streetlights too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nightportraits/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, tiny post over. The pride pictures are mostly edited, they'll be along sometime soon.</description>

          <description>I'm posting this from the backyard of a cookout after pride parade. I promise, this is the last of the tulsa photos.

          <title>skate photos...</title>
          <description>I said at the time on twitter, that I wished for a wider lens, but really I think these aren't bad at all. A camera that can shoot sequences would be nice, and I could have shot more varied things with more lenses, but I think sometimes limitations can drive creativity, and that's what happened here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everybody that's tired of Tulsa pictures and posts, don't worry, I've got one more small post and then it's back to OKC pictures. And yeah, I could have put up all these pictures at once, but would you have looked as much at them, seen them as well? Anyway, there'll be a lot of pictures from pride parade hopefully, and I've a few from this week too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0027.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0028.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0029.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0030.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0031.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0032.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0033.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0034.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0035.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0036.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0037.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0038.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alltulsa/0039.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>More Tulsa, With Cars!</title>
          <description>SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY... was when I took these. Sunday morning, mostly, although the car show was in the afternoon. i really wasn't that impressed visually with the cars... i liked their style, I thought the work was impressive, but visually to me cars are just a big dead thing in the frame. If I'd been reporting on the car show, I would have picked out little details, but as it was I was just walking around with Rachel and Gretchen, all of us trying not to die in the heat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0004.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0005.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0006.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0007.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tulsaweekend2/0008.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming soon (after I take a nap to kill the hangover): The skate sessions.</description>

          <title>Oh the life of a freelancer...</title>
          <description>A week ago, I went down to medicine park to assist &lt;a href =&quot;http://www.jeremycharles.com&quot;&gt;Jeremy Charles&lt;/a&gt; with a little advertorial. Hold the reflector, keep the lights from blowing away, that sort of thing. While I was there, I had a little down time to walk up the main drag and shoot a few pics of the town, and while details were being decided, I was able to shoot the little kid who was the subject of the ad in question. It was nice to get out and shoot in the mode of dropping into a location, gestalting, and shooting pictures based on those impressions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also always nice to work with a pro of Jeremy's caliber, someone who knows their look, knows their gear, lights, who &quot;gets it.&quot; That said, working with a family of four who are inexperienced in front of the camera, and having two small kids in that mix, was stressful.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0009.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0010.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0011.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0012.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0013.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0014.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0015.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0016.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0017.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0018.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>Mom was in the hospital...</title>
          <description>for once, i actually managed to Shoot pictures of mom from start to finish in the hospital. This visit was more than a little silly. She had a non-specific infection, possbly blood, possibly kidney, but they made her stay in the hospital for 4 days when she could have stayed at home. Ostensibly it was to monitor her, but I don' think we would have done a worse job of that at home. Add to that the stress factor of being in the hospital, and the whole thing was kind of ridiculous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; font-size=&quot;smaller&quot;&gt;Mom the day she went to the dialysis clinic with a fever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0001.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; font-size=&quot;smaller&quot;&gt;The first cultures, which were the only ones that came back positive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0002.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; font-size=&quot;smaller&quot;&gt;Hallway going into Presbyterian Tower, OU Med center. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0003.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; font-size=&quot;smaller&quot;&gt;Mom coming back from the vending machines. Not happy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0004.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; font-size=&quot;smaller&quot;&gt;In the last few minutes of her stay, the doctor came in and removed her catheter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/lastfilm/0005.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, she did feel quite a bit better getting out (no more infection), and she doesn't have a cardiac catheter any more- the leg graft they did several months ago is working, and as of today, she's about halfway through training to stick herself and do the whole thing at home again.</description>

          <title>Velvet monkey opening/16th st. Friday</title>
          <description>All I have to say is I was really off that night. A lot of blurry pics from too low a shutter speed. So that's why the coverage isn't as good as it should be.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/16thstmonkey/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Brofest</title>
          <description>These pictures are all from the raddest ride kickoff/fundraiser ever. Stuart, Pat and Cameron are heading across the country on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://broquest.com/&quot;&gt;Broquest&lt;/a&gt; (link goes to their site). This is why film sucks sometimes; I'm just now getting the pics from their out of town party up and they're already three states into their Portland to Portland run. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dudes of America played, and they're a bunch of rockstars. I'm too lazy to caption, you can figure it out. That and I'm blogging while flying down the highway. wah-hoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/brofest1/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>random</title>
          <description>So I've finally gotten my film developed, and the first batch is just some random photos. There was another roll of old film I found in a drawer, and I think at least one of these is from that. It's really weird and difficult to be working with files scanned from film automatically. I can't adjust exposure or white balance or any of that good stuff. Oh well, at least they're better than nothing. I can't wait until I get a new body in though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film1/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>lack of posting (and why)</title>
          <description>So I've been doing stuff and seeing things, but the reason I haven't been posting that much is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/film.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's almost a week's worth of shooting. I know, I know, that's not a lot, but it will make for about a week's worth of posts, once I get around to developing it. I'm waiting on some money from a lens I sold. (With my canon body out of commission, I didn't need the 24-105 any more, so it went on ebay and sold quick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, there was a race yesterday, Bike Against Hunger the First, which was pretty cool. Kudos to Ken for putting it together and for all the rad prizes. Cody won, and I'd swear he rode up to my checkpoint on one wheel. He was there and gone in about 10 seconds. Yeah though, if you ever get the chance to work a checkpoint, bring a sign and a nice chair. A beverage and a book are optional but the book probably saved my sanity, i just wished I'd had the rest of that stuff. That, and it's impossible to run a checkpoint and take pics of the checkpoint at the same time. It's one or the other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I'm going to save the rest for another day, because there are a lot of stories to tell, and a lot of pictures that go with them, so rather than mix things all about, I'll just wait until I can get the pictures, and then tell the stories.</description>

          <title>people suck</title>
          <description>The comments on the story about the accident in tulsa are really terrible, really sad. I can't believe people actually think like that, that the solution to driver negligence (which is almost always the case of bike accidents involving a bike and a car) is for cyclists to not ride their bikes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ride a &lt;span &gt;road bike&lt;/span&gt;. I ride it on the road because it's made for pavement, and because it's illegal for me to ride on the sidewalk. For a lot of miles of my riding, there are no sidewalks. Bike trails are nice where the exist, and I don't mind dodging pedestrians and slower cyclists even, but the trails almost never go anywhere useful. I ride in the middle of the lane because that's the safest place for me to be. I am more noticeable and to pass me you have to use the other lane. I'm almost never on roads that don't have a passing lane, at least when traffic is an issue. Every cyclist with any experience knows the roads with the best pavement and least traffic to get where they are going, and new cyclists often hear about them the first time they meet other riders ('You take 10th st all the way from where? no no no, take 4th to downtown, then...').&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a driver, watch where you're going and don't drive drunk, ok? I see a lot of people bitching on the internet about aggro/self righteous cyclists, but if a random cyclist started killing drivers at random, and got away with it (hit and runs are the rule), wouldn't you be mad at them? This case would have been just like that, if an eyewitness hadn't run the driver off the road to stop her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fact: you have to double or triple your speed to reduce time traveled by a significant amount when driving in town. That means that even a full 60 seconds waiting behind a cyclist (this is a lot longer than you think) going 15 mph waiting to pass is only going to slow you by about 30 seconds in your overall travel time. You spend more time than that sitting at red lights, making coffee or chatting with co-workers. Hell, I spend more time staring at the wall persuading myself to get out of bed. It's not worth getting upset over and certainly not worth killing some poor guy who's just trying to get somewhere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a cyclist, be careful. You'd look hotter in a helmet, and by hotter I mean sexier without head injuries. Use lower traffic roads, lights, and bright clothing. Of course, none of that helped me this last time, but I know it's saved me a thousand other times. Don't be an asshole, but take the lane, it's yours by law, and if you're off to the side, it's easier to go unnoticed. If a driver is coming towards you, yell at them, whatever you feel like yelling, as loud as you can. More than once yelling &quot;HEY!&quot; has saved my bacon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that's all. Good luck and good night.</description>

          <title>Car Kills Two Cyclists in Tulsa, third in hospital</title>
          <description>I already posted this to twitter, but I figure more people will see it if I put it here too. I look at all those bike pieces scattered in the road, and I'm thinking, if my bike had been super light carbon, that'd be me. Lugged Steel Saved My Life. (For those that don't know: I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/blog/2009/05/wreck.html&quot;&gt;hit a couple weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; by an inattentive driver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Text story &lt;a href=&quot;http://artfa.gs/driver-kills&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and video: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.newson6.com/global/video/videoplayer.js?rnd=882102;hostDomain=www.newson6.com;playerWidth=400;playerHeight=340;isShowIcon=true;clipId=3849424;playerType=POPUP_EMBEDDEDscript'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sad day. My heart goes out to the dude in the hospital and the families of the dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(another post to follow, more generally about sharing the road.)</description>

          <title>Wednesday photos</title>
          <description>This is sort of a test post, I'm mucking about with the stylesheet. I'm also writing some essays for the photobook I've been trying to do since january. Wednesday was a success though, in that I got out and had a good time. And I took some photos. The style might not be right, but I'm working on it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bbwt/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bbwt/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bbwt/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bbwt/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <description>This is from the rest of the last batch of processing. Traci (last picture) came and rescued me from my stircrazyness on Friday, whereupon we went downtown and walked around, lots of fun things to see around that time of day, just as work is getting out. Then there was sauced pizza and a norman party, where everybody thought my brace was fake until I told them the story. Getting out again, I've told that same story 20 million times. hopefully I'm done telling it now, but I have a feeling I won't be able to stop until I'm done wearing the brace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;My dad, playing with the dog. I don't know what occasioned this look. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Most people would take a picture of the statue that this camera watches, but I found the sign much more interesting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I know I've taken and shown similar, but I don't care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This is the inside of an old bank building, downtown.

With ISO 400 film, this was like 1/30th of a second at f/1.2. The party was darker, so those pictures didn't really work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>old photos..</title>
          <description>since I've had to resort to shooting film, I had to get it processed, and there was this random roll that has been on my printer stand for a while, so I had it done as well. These are from the end of spring 2006, at the annual Doc Studies barbecue. Looking at this old work, I couldn't help but notice how different it is, and how much higher a percentage of misses I had back then, even with the same camera &amp; lens.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Two of the graduating seniors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Professors standing around. The difference in the personalities from right to left is so huge, if they stood any closer, the universe would have exploded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Kari, my girlfriend at the time. I'm going to leave it as an exercise for the reader to make up what happened between us. I can tell you it won't be as interesting as what actually happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/severalposts/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Paseo arts fest</title>
          <description>I forgot my cf cards, and so I had to improvise and use my phone camera to take a few pictures. It was a very zen experience shooting this way, with complete simplicity. I was able to concentrate soley on the images.  you only have one button to push, and that's it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sitting there, at sauced, at Haley's booth, and I was watching all the ametures with their digital rebels, and I realized that the difference between them and the professionals I had worked around and with was principally one of concentration. The pros are zeroed in on what they are doing, the only thing in the world for them is the viewfinder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Matty from the Rodchenko(sp?) angle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a completely different note, I found a really cool company called Elphel building the open source camera I dreamed up last year. they sell a bunch of boards that could theoretically turn any old 35mm film camera into a digital camera, in either black and white or color. Their examples kinda suck, and I suspect it has something to do with the tone curves they're using, but if I can get the parts and get it to spit out 16 bit raw data, I would be one happy matt mills. For the nerds: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.elphel.com/&quot;&gt;Elphel's web site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/zenessay/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>it's 6:30 and I'm still up. time to give up on sleep?</title>
          <description>(note: where I say today, I'm mostly talking about sunday, as I started writing this at about 5am monday morning, thinking still as if &quot;today&quot; were sunday. It's a total brain dump/rant, but there's a lot of good tidbits, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't sleep. Maybe if I write everything down that's on my mind, I can get some peace and rest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lawyer situation: I've made the initial contact with someone who is supposed to be good, but may or may not know anything about bikes/bike law. I sent along the police report, descriptions of my injuries and the photo of the bike I put on twitter. So, on that, I'm waiting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Injuries: everything was better today, except for right after I woke up; moving around a little worked out the little bit of stiffness that I had, and the only thing that's bothered me all day has been my ankle, and that only in the last couple hours. For some reason, bad days seem to follow the good ones, and I'm more than a little afraid of waking up in agony. Maybe that's why I can't sleep. No pain pills today though, that's something. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the subject of pain pills, I'm somewhat divided, because on the one hand, they allow me to function on the bad days, at the worst moments, I can still get out of bed and move about the house, but I'm always a little hazy on those days, and it's nice to be clear. Would I just be in bed, suffering? Does pain by itself slow healing? When will I stop feeling like I've been hit by a car at 35mph?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions for the doctor (appointment on the second): How long will it take me to recover? How much of a recovery can I expect to make? Am I permanently damaged? When can I get rid of the shell? Where is the break exactly? Can I see my X-rays? How much PT (physical therapy) will I need? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions for the lawyer: How hard is this going to be? Is all of my stuff (bike, camera) covered? How much PT will I be able to afford? What about lost work time/income? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've got lists of things that I need and/or want; things that are missing, notably my passport and notebook and flask; lists that I don't know if I'll ever tick off all the items or not. How is it that despite being an invalid unable to drive or walk I have so much to accomplish? And the number of little side things on my mind, besides. For example: I have to get my car registered and licensed this week, and I'm thinking about either getting an iphone or fixing the netbook, but I don't really know which to do, and I can't do anything at all about these things till friday, which is when I get my last paycheck from OSU. The paycheck is a surprise, though. I'm glad for it, and that I'll be able to fix/do stuff once I get it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there's all the nice stuff people have done for me, from loaning books to bringing me beer to just coming over and hanging out and talking. I have a stack of comic books that I've read thanks to Cyrus and a bunch of DVDs that I've half watched on the nod, thanks to Adam M. I had the best cup of coffee I've ever tasted while I was still in the hospital thanks to Francois. I've got beer and good literature thanks to Stuart. I'm just now digging into the lit. Ken got me a freakin' camera, even if it is just on loan for a while. That's why there's still a trickle of pictures up here. I haven't forgotten any of you, and I'm trying to think of something nice to do, in gratitude, once I'm back on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's about it. I think I've gone from the surface to the deep parts of what's on my mind. If I wrote any more, I'd be telling my life story, as all the other thoughts I have are just snippets of anecdotes from disconnected stories.</description>

          <title>sam's club and the electric cart</title>
          <description>I've never before actually needed to ride in one, but they say there's a first for everything. Today, I used one of those electric carts to get around sams. FYI, they're a pain when you have to use them. That and for some reason I kept getting dirty looks; I guess because I have the brace on under my shirt people thought I was a healthy person abusing the cart, if that were possible. Oh well. Photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;For memorial day, or whatever holiday this is. Yay flag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/electriccart/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Bathroom sign at old chicago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/electriccart/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;And finally some rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/electriccart/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Out of the house</title>
          <description>Went out last night. Did the whole blue note/ladies night thing. Tommy G came and picked me up, and off we went, into the night. It was nice to see some of the people out that I hadn't seen in two weeks. Of course, as sure as the night before, the morning after is a bitch. I woke up and I couldn't move, there was a lot of pain. I'm sure it was a combination of attempting to detox and the night out, but still, I'm glad the pain pills were within arms reach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as things stand, I still need to get a lawyer, I don't know if there's going to be long term damage, and I still don't have a job. Sometimes I need the pain pills and sometimes I don't. it seems to depend on what I've been doing more than anything; the easier I take it, the better off I am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good news list, I have a camera now, thanks to Ken's boss. It's a digi Rebel, nothing to write home about, but it's functional, at least, and I figure I could do worse. It's not like I have any assignments anyway. Project idea: Photograph all the stuff people have loaned/given me while convalescing. I might work on that after my nap. photos of last night to follow later too.</description>

          <title>fallout</title>
          <description>I write this blog for two reasons, to share pictures and so all the people in my life, no matter how far flung, can get an idea of what's going on in my life. Now, since I had the wreck last tuesday, I've only posted once, just putting up some details and leaving it at that. Since then I've been popping pain pills at regular intervals and working my way through the stack of comic books and movies my friends brought by. Then someone bitches in the comments that I'm boring him. I told him to go fuck himself, because, hey, I deserve a couple days off for the broken back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I do have a few updates to pass along. I got out of the hospital Friday, and promptly took a nap. When I woke up I realized I hadn't looked at my camera in several days, so I pulled it out and found it was broken. My 50mm 1.2 won't autofocus and the mode dial no longer works at all. And the battery door is broken off. The bag I was carrying has a hole in it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's hard to get up and down, but I can walk and stand pretty well, although that does depend on me keeping up with the pain pills- one every four hours and I can move and function pretty well. On the pain meds, I can do most normal stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't take any before I went to sleep last night, mostly because I was feeling fine and I really don't like the drugged feeling. This morning, I was regretting that decision, because all of the minor aches had turned to major ones, and it was a task just to sit up in bed. I took pills, and now I'm fine. I can't wait for the day when I don't depend on pills to get around the house. Should be soon.</description>

          <title>the wreck</title>
          <description>since I've told this about twenty times yesterday and today, and a lot of those tellings were under the influence of strong drugs, i figure one more time won't hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was riding my bike into town on 4th street and a car &lt;span &gt;t-boned me&lt;/span&gt; hit me from the rear. The lady said she was singing to her kids. my lights were on, and i'd bet they weren't looking. I can't remember any of what happened. paramedics said the car was pretty messed up, but they also noticed I had my lights on. at least the car didn't run off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they took me to ou med center, where they determined I have a spinal fracture but no damage to my spinal cord. bruised ribs, some cuts, and my right ankle is stiff. I'm alive and I'll heal, which is the good news. i'm going to be laid up for a while though, have to wear a torso brace for 6 weeks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everybody's been awesome, thanks for all the support, food, books, and just dropping in to visit. I'm here till tomorrow at least, then home and more rest. pills. no bike for a while. if you want to get in touch but don't have my number, just send me a direct message on twitter. laters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Edit to fix how the accident happened, I was more bruised on one side than the other, making me think I was t-boned).</description>

          <title>Finally, I know where the flats are coming from</title>
          <description>Or at least some of them. It's a bad idea to leave your bike in a hot car- heat raises pressure and softens rubber, and then before you know it, you've had 10 flats in just a few weeks. And it's always a bummer to go out to get your wheels for a ride and find flats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night was a typical monday- blue note pool, tommy g night ride, but with a couple bonuses. Ran into some people who told me rumors of photo work, so that's pretty awesome. Also: Alibi's, which I'd never been to before last night, has $3 bottomless cups of beer. It's shitty light beer, but it will make drunkface just fine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Meet Tasha. Cool chick. I fixed her bike a little. And by fixed her bike, you know what I mean. Flat tire, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after some drinking, it was time to ride and work off the beer. We got about a mile, and then I had a blowout. My guess is my rim strip already had a hole from the first blowout of the night, which happened in my car before the evening started. So, I had to sit around and wait for some one to go grab my car, and then we made a walmart run for more tubes, and then the ride was back on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;self, tasha. Tommy needs his own camera, he's got a good eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time we were actually riding, it was 3:30am. We did a couple parking garages, a little bricktown, I skidded the ramp in front of the theater (it's a really long ass ramp, ~100 yards), and the freewheel riding dudes (tommy and lem) I was with didn't care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&quot;Wouldn't it be cool to climb that fire escape,&quot; Tommy said. &quot;Except for the fall and die part,&quot; I said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Lem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Tommy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/alibiride/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Water Boarding Party</title>
          <description>remember when I said I was bored with taking pictures of drunk people? somebody heard that and responded with the wildest, craziest thing I've ever seen at a party. They had a water boarding party. In priest robes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They swore up and down that they'd gotten them legally. The robes. And as for the water torture, well, what's a little torture between friends?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, everyone pouring got poured on too, so it was at least sort of fair. And there was a &quot;safe word,&quot; in the form of a hammer that the person on the board would drop when they'd had enough. Which was usually seconds. Nobody made it very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, you're thinking to yourself, &quot;Did MM get waterboarded?&quot; and the answer is a definite no. I drowned &lt;a href=&quot;http://payingoffmyloans.blogspot.com/2008/01/nine-times-ive-nearly-died-pt-1.html&quot;&gt;once before&lt;/a&gt; (note, the near-death count has gone up since then), was resuscitated, and for about six years of my childhood I didn't go near the water, and I took very shallow baths. So, I don't need to experience simulated drowning, I've had the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the torture, it was a pretty standard evening, with a lot of beer and liquor consumed, and crashing out on the couch. I hadn't been letting myself get that drunk, but once in a while it's fun. At least I didn't black out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0019.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0020.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0021.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0022.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0023.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0024.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0025.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0026.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0027.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/waterboard/0028.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

For a dude like me, who doesn't have normal, that means it was extra special. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;A little taste of ISO 25,000. THIS IS HOW REAL MEN TAKE PICTURES.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(edit out long drawn out account of room cleaning, wheel building, and finally bike tube acquisition, which was crazy to do, but after writing it out, boring to tell). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;These two old dudes were just sitting togetther mooning over each other in a loud bar filled with people a third their age. Aww.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was booze cruise and Sauced and Hi lo, and hanging out at Erin/Colby's place, with some random Cmay thrown in just because my night wasn't interesting enough already. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;People always do this. Not usually in triplicate, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/feelslikesat/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a random somewhat tangentially related note (but who wants boring details?) I realized last night that I like philosophies that allow me to do nothing and reap benefits for it. That's all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Bike ride?

          <title>I hate grading</title>
          <description>You know that story about how some monasteries require applicants to stand outside and wait for three days before they can enter? After a semester of teaching a bunch of kids who are just there to fill in a blank on their degree rubric, I understand that now. So many people aren't in college to learn, they're there to buy a piece of paper. And when you expect them to do more than sit there in class and stare at the wall, they balk. Sometimes there's one or two good students, but they're the exception. It would be nice if we could limit our students to those who wanted to learn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Dinner on no diet day. Gotta love it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grill.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well. I'll never be an ancient sage of anything, either, and I'm not taking another teaching job, unless it's teaching photography as art. I'll never forget the blank faces I got after showing my students &quot;La Jetee.&quot; It wasn't that they didn't understand the film, they had just ignored it. Anyway, the sun is shining, the outside is gorgeous, and I'm off.</description>

          <title>stoking my paranoia</title>
          <description>from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/05/an_expectation.html&quot;&gt;Schneier&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... Twenty years ago, if someone wanted to look through your correspondence, he had to break into your house. Now, he can just break into your ISP. Ten years ago, your voicemail was on an answering machine in your office; now it's on a computer owned by a telephone company. Your financial accounts are on remote websites protected only by passwords; your credit history is collected, stored, and sold by companies you don't even know exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And more data is being generated. Lists of books you buy, as well as the books you look at, are stored in the computers of online booksellers. Your affinity card tells your supermarket what foods you like. What were cash transactions are now credit card transactions. What used to be an anonymous coin tossed into a toll booth is now an EZ Pass record of which highway you were on, and when. What used to be a face-to-face chat is now an e-mail, IM, or SMS conversation -- or maybe a conversation inside Facebook.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

          <title>Just to prove that I don't just shoot parties...</title>
          <description>I took my camera to the grocery store. I have an idea: to make interesting pictures when nothing is happening. It's a weird personal barrier I have, a switch that is either on or off in my head; if it doesn't seem to me like anything is happening, then nothing is. Of course, something is always happening, &quot;the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock.&quot; (james baldwin) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/crestmonday/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/crestmonday/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/crestmonday/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/crestmonday/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/crestmonday/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>And then came saturday...</title>
          <description>I spent a lot of last week in bed, although not in a good way. I was laid low by some upper respiratory virus, most likely a cold, but maybe the flu. No swollen glands or soreness, though, and no high fever, so probably not. Wednesday I was fine, Thursday I woke up and had a sore throat and slept all day and then felt fine, Friday I felt like shit all day so I stayed in and out of the rain, and then came Saturday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/melissasgoingaway/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, I was supposed to meet up with a certain lady to hang out. So I text her  around 6:30, she says she's still at work, so I tell her to just let me know when she gets free, and we can coordinate then. 10:30 rolls around, no news, so I decide to head out on my own. I still haven't heard back from her. Can't win 'em all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/melissasgoingaway/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Sauced for a few good beers and then Blue note for a few less good beers, and then Cyrus texts me and says he's at a party around the corner. So I say I'll be there in a hot minute and head out. Side note: Paying in cash means you can leave whenever you want to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/melissasgoingaway/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I get to the party and no Cyrus. There were a bunch of people I didn't know and one that I did; it was Melissa's going away party. So, I turned my gregariousness up to 11 and met a bunch of new people, although I'm afraid by that time I was more fueled by booze than by social graces. Then there was more beer and more hard liquor and a lot of blurry moments. Cyrus got back maybe 15 minutes after I'd arrived, with more beer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/melissasgoingaway/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, after more beer and some whiskey, I extracted myself from the party, wandered around a bit, decided I should park the car, got on my bike, wandered a bit more and ended up crashing on Cyrus' couch. I realized this morning that that particular party was the kind where you have a really good time while there and then only later realize you were making a complete fool out of yourself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/melissasgoingaway/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was a typical sunday: Jeff's for brunch, video games, movies, pizza, bar, home. I've got to get a job, and an apartment, and a motorcycle. In that order. Ah, goals. It's nice to have those again.</description>

          <title>Hiatus</title>
          <description>Sorry for the hiatus. I've been stupid and self-doubting or maybe smart and self doubting. And I've been sick. Anyway, while my hard drive is restoring from backup, I thought I'd share a few of the week's lesser failures. Actually, looking at the pix, they're not that bad. Lighting in clubs is just impossible unless you bring your own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shot these all last wednesday, at Kamp's deli. It turns into the latest and greatest OKC dance club on wednesday nights. It might be there more often, but I really don't know. It was actually really fun, there was a good spread of music and a good spread of people. Lots of photographers, although I was the only one not using flash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not leaving out the captions out of laziness or unremembered details, but I really think these don't need anything to explain them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/kampswed/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>because I'm a sucker for a pretty lady</title>
          <description>and because it's her birthday, and because, well, what are friends for? I'm posting yet another huge batch of photos to flickr. This time though, I'm going to be smart and only post highlights here and if you want to see the whole set you can head over there &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/photomattmills/sets/72157617411519820/show/&quot;&gt;by clicking this finely crafted link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I find that I know I have enough good pictures of something and yet I'm still shooting, something is knawing at me to keep going, and I don't really know why. On an &quot;on&quot; night, this means I come away with quite a lot of good stuff. This shoot was about 5% that I liked, and maybe as high as 20% that weren't crap, even by my standards. In a small party, that means a lot of pictures of the same people, and yet some people get missed, too. Sorry if I missed you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/rachelsparty/0018.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Norman Music Fest</title>
          <description>This is the 200th post here, and to celebrate, I'm being lazy and trying flickr's embedded slideshows. These are all from norman music fest, taken yesterday. Sorry it's flash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;560&quot;&gt; &lt;param name=&quot;flashvars&quot; value=&quot;offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fphotomattmills%2Fsets%2F72157617360997934%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fphotomattmills%2Fsets%2F72157617360997934%2F&amp;set_id=72157617360997934&amp;jump_to=&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=70933&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; src=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=70933&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot; flashvars=&quot;offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fphotomattmills%2Fsets%2F72157617360997934%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fphotomattmills%2Fsets%2F72157617360997934%2F&amp;set_id=72157617360997934&amp;jump_to=&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</description>

          <title>Clearing off the card...</title>
          <description>In anticipation of a monster weekend (Norman music fest tomorrow, arts fest tonight if I can get my ass in gear), I had to clear off the card in the camera, and because I love you all so much, I'm sharing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;No matter what I do to this tree in Lightroom, it's still just a tree. I still kinda like it though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/morecaptions/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Polo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/morecaptions/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Cookout after polo. seriously good burgers and salsa at the Murray's house. (sorry if I just butchered your name, Adam)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/morecaptions/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Trying to get together a mutant stretched bike. Don't know if they succeeded, I left for the Blue note.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/morecaptions/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Hipshot, this girl was in her own world, literally dancing to a beat only she could hear. Which is too silly, because if the music had gone with what she was dancing, she wouldn't have been half bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/morecaptions/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>23rd street</title>
          <description>So I finally got out and shot some yesterday, for the first time in three or four days. I don't know what exactly caused the slump; I've been doing a lot around the house, just sort of hanging out with friends, nothing terribly interesting. So I decided to do something with myself. Calling around to find someone to model failed, everyrone was either recovering from the weekend or not answering their phones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, no pretty ladies in these pictures. I had the crazy idea to go way out on 23rd street yesterday, and along the way I was sort of pulled in by all the signs I saw. I'm going to have to go back and shoot some more out there; might do a photo-walk of the few miles between choctaw and post road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This victorian house was out in the middle of a lot of mobile homes for sale; it looked more like a storage for unwanted uprooted homes than a sales lot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I shot this mostly for the patch of light and the clouds. These tonalities are really difficult to get right on a screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Like I said, signs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This last one was taken of the wig shop, much later at night. It's a really strange looking place. I have to remember to try to go in there when they're open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sunday23rdst/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>This post is all captions</title>
          <description>&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Went to the bike art opening, a lot of Norman scenesters and young parents in the crowd. The art was ok, the bikes were cool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;This was the coolest part: the fixed-gear as objet d'art. That and chris' paintings; my only criticism is I wish they were bigger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;This was supposed to be a bike theremin, but it was about 3/4 fail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;The jumps they were doing were pretty cool though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;This is Amanda. The next five pix are another unintentional photo essay. I was basically hanging out with her the whole night, although the background kept changing and some people came and went. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;For example: After we left Norman, we went to Estrella and MJ's place. Very cool casa. I'm guessing this was some kind of decorative place setting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Does this really need explanation? Seriously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Outside the blue note. She says to me &quot;You have your camera?&quot; I say, &quot;Of course,&quot; and she runs and jumps and lays down on the sign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;I know I promised five pictures, and that's because there's a story with this one. This was the hostess at a pary we headed to after the blue note. Shortly after this was taken, this girl grabs Amanda by the hair and won't let go, all for a jello shot cup thrown on the floor. We had a good laugh about that in the car, leaving. Then Reghan (who'd joined us for the blue note and after) shouts out of the window &quot;We know where you live!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;This is a true rocker. Notice that Caitlin's entire body is in motion, &lt;span &gt;except for the beer.&lt;/span&gt; Epic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&quot;Take one for the dudes of america,&quot; he said. So I did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fukidol/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

I made a little trip to norman, basically to fix a light for some friends. They couldn't get the globe back on. It was actually on of those &quot;any excuse to get out of the house is a good one&quot; trips. Heading down there, the traffic was epic, and then my exit was closed, so I got lost, and it ended up taking me 45 minutes for a 20 minute trip. typical. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all that effort though, I was rewarded. Tracy (my friend with the broken light, remember?) made two pizzas. There would be pictures of them, but I was busy eating it. Delicious. Then I got introduced to &quot;it's always sunny in philadelphia&quot; which is a combination of awesome and strange and disturbing. the night then proceeded to get better. I took this photo on the way out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to the blue note, where there was much pool playing and a little drinking. Ran into Tommy G and Josh, and it was actually mostly dry, so we went riding. Couple parking garages scaled, a ride to best buy where we discovered that their trash was sealed. Exhaustion. Home. bed. That's about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Tommy g with the evil look of the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;me, taken by dude who's name I can't remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bestbuydumpsternight/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;No name dude, by me.

          <title>Time for a new bag</title>
          <description>This is one of those &quot;the shit in my bag&quot; posts, sort of. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/blog/2008/04/things-i-carry.html&quot;&gt;Way back when&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't carry that much, life was simple, and if there was anything I needed but didn't have, I could usually just do without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things are more complicated for me now. I often find myself away from home for a couple days at a time, so the stuff I carry has ballooned a bit. For the last several months I've been using a &quot;Metropolis&quot; chrome bag (I've had the bag for years, actually, but I prefer smaller bags when I can get away with them). The problem with the bag, and shoulder bags in general, is that they're very picky about how they're packed- if things are arranged wrong, something's always digging into your back, and if they're full, they stick out and fit weird. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but it seems to me that when you've got a lot of gear, a backpack is the way to haul it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And actually, the chrome bag is the perfect size for the hardware I carry- my cameras, my laptop, the cords and chargers, etc. But if I need anything more, say a jacket, an extra layer of clothing, and/or a water bottle, then there's just not enough room to wear it comfortably. This was brought home rather painfully this morning trying to bike in a t-shirt with a wind chill of 30ËšF. I made it from 23rd and robinson to 10th and broadway- about a mile, give or take some meandering and alleys. I could tell that trying to ride the rest of the way home from there would be a bad idea- a frozen matt mills can't ride his bike or take pictures or philander or any of the fun stuff. Beyond that, dying of exposure in the city with a charged cell phone is stupid. So I called my dad, and he came and picked me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;I'm too lazy to make a list, and this photo is short my flask and some tools I can't seem to find, but this is everything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/stuff.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a chronic couch surfer, a product of living in the burbs and partying in the city. That and all my friends live in the city. The best solution would be to move, and as soon as I have a job that lasts more than two weeks, I'm going to do that. (Remember: I'm available to photograph anything but weddings, even on short notice). For now though, I'm switching bags. Sorry Chrome, you're cool and all, but it's time to go back to my roots, a nice big backpack I've had for like 10 years. Stuffed very full, it'll hold everything I need for a week of hard travel- say, everything I'd encounter between here and timbuktu. As it is, I can put everything I need for a weekend of night parties and morning blogging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The bag all loaded. Not too huge.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/bag.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>4 hrs</title>
          <description>4 hours sleep... moving the banked track with the RDR roller girls... five hours of bike polo. Can't think straight. So photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;I know this is from last night, and you know where to file complaints. I like it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nothinking/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Moving party!

          <title>Awake and working after the party</title>
          <description>&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Mesta park, rolling around, version 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/scannerday/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mornings like this one are why I started carrying my laptop in the first place. everyone else is fast asleep, but I'm up, can't sleep, and so it works out that I should be here, typing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was one hell of a day. I got up and made myself the perfect cup of coffee, Siracha coffee beans in the french press. Then I had another cup, the bottom of the pot, while I caught up on newsfeeds and twitter and all that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;And then this is version 2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/scannerday/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was chatting with Grant, I had a brilliant idea: convert my used cd's into a radio scanner. What use is a scanner, you say? Information about what is going on. News as it happens. Things to take photos of. This particular conversion was by way of the used record store, so I grabbed all the ones that were worth anything, and started to head that direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got as far as my car, which I discovered was dead, and so I tried to start my other car (a mostly-broken mercury sable) and found that it too was dead. So I went back in the house, got my bike, and headed to the record store. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get to the shop, tell the lady I'm selling if she's buying, and she takes my stack of cd's to examine them and make me an offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;$55?&quot; the woman behind the counter offers, rejecting one. &quot;Sure,&quot; I reply- it doesn't seem like enough, but I'm hoping to hit up a pawn shop and get lucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/scannerday/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the first pawn shop I go to, I have to explain that no, a scanner isn't the same as a CB. They don't have anything. I'm ready to give up on the day at this point, but as my path took me down reno towards downtown, I passed another pawn shop, and stopped in to see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of those slightly sketchy places, the kind that sells more guns and ammo than anything. That, and they have a large selection of used tools. I asked one of the guys behind the counter, did they have any scanners? He allows that they do, right this way. He one pulls down from a shelf which is mostly pistol ammo, a handheld that seems perfect. I turn it over and see the price: $69.99. He's gone off to ring up someone else, so I fiddle with it a bit, find out that it covers a ton of spectrum,and then when I get his attention, I ask him if he'll take 50 for it. He says yes, 50 plus tax, and so I say sold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This was pretty much the entire crowd the whole time I was at Uptown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/scannerday/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there, I go to fourth street and ride into the city. Beatnix for lunch, and they really do have the best hot roast beef in town. If only they'd get sourdough bread, it'd be perfect. I sat there after my sandwich was finished, and programmed in all the frequencies that the public services us here in the city- something like 35 channels in all. Then I have business to do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The saga of the missing pictures continued with yours truly going to sauced and finding them still down, but Matty promised they'd be up by five, and that they were just moving things around, etc, etc. Which reminds me, I've gotta go back by there today and see what they put up, how it was done, and really if anything got done at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/scannerday/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I killed about two hours then, playing with my new radio in the park. The thing I've heard on that thing already are hilarious and interesting and I think it might work out to be a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner with Grant, Damaris, Timmy, Kolby, Erin, and this girl from Tulsa, can't think of her name, it might come to me later. Indian food, way out on 23rd street, really good, really filling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Random dude. Every party needs at least one to liven things up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/scannerday/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it was time to go to the dance party, only there wasn't much dancing or partying going on at uptown united. For most of the time I was there, there were more people chilling outside than inside dancing. And I do mean chilling. It got chilly for this correspondent; I was only wearing a t-shirt, though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Timmy, passin' out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/scannerday/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting an hour and drinking all of my beer, The party still wasn't really going, So I left, back to rendezvous with Timmy and some of the rest of the gang; we met at Grant's, and then went from there to the former bike cave, where there was much drinking and cards and dice, and pizza and passing out also. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This was the pizza part of the evening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/scannerday/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The dog even got some.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/scannerday/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There. That was my friday. Now I'm going to try to pass out for a little while.</description>

          <title>Blue Note. Again.</title>
          <description>At the blue note on a wednesday, although I started the night at McNellie's. It feels better to be making portraits, although I've lost all sense as to whether these are any good or not. I was just a little off the whole night (actually, for the last several nights) and  I can't put my finger on why, exactly. Oh well, it'll work itself out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Cat gives me the crazy eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This is a look that says &quot;I can't believe I've run into my ex&quot; and &quot;How can I get away from him?&quot; Trust me, I was there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Cyrus does normal? is this a fluke?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Midnight bike rides part eleventy-million</title>
          <description>Tuesday, I went out for a bike ride, just to get a little air, and ended up at the blue note, which has become my bar of first resort. I actually made really good time on the ride in, at least for me: 7 miles in half an hour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got there, Chris was sitting at the bar (hi chris). Next thing I know, I'm doing an irish car bomb with him and Victoria, and the night rolls out from there.  A couple beers and a couple shots later, we head back to Chris' house. On the way, I confirmed what I'd heard earlier in the day: my work had all been taken down from Sauced. It's gone, and I'm pissed. Fuck Sauced. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Eyeing a bolt-hole to attach the chain guard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we got to Chris' house, which he shares with KW, and I watched Lisa put the finishing touches on her bike. It's a cute girl cruiser, fashionable and functional. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The bike. Yes, I know it'a a little blurry, so was I.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I rode my ass home, no idea how long it took, but it was a pretty nice ride, except for the south wind. I always pass by this last scene, but for some reason early on April Fool's day, it grabbed me. Who cares if I look foolish? Nobody was around, anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/somethingwrong/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>I suck at team sports pt 1</title>
          <description>I'm sure there will eventually be a part two to this, but my stomach started disagreeing with me, and is only now, a day and a half later, finally settling down. So I only played one game, and only shot two of them, and then I ran off to drink (see previous post).

          <title>ok, some pictures already</title>
          <description>It was a nice uneventful weekend... well, things happened, but it was fun and nobody got hurt this time, which is to say no fights, trips to the hospital, supergluing of wounds, etc. So all of the things that have defined my weekends of partying didn't happen. Just drinking, followed by sobering up in some chill spot (thanks to the bike cave and the schofield house, respectively, for their hospitality). Anyway, photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Matty at HiLo- yes, that's a plastic tiara on his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Tanner, at the bike cave, concentrating on some Texas hold 'em. I passed out like a narcoleptic on valium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Andria, while she was getting me shitfaced on sunday afternoon. Jager is still a good time though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Bartender, chatting. This was moments after she was showing off her tongue's lack of connective tissue. I like this picture better though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Trinity and her beau, forgotten his name. She was saying something about me taking pictures at monster's ball. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Rainstorms, tonight. Hope tomorrow is nice, I've got work to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/notalot/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll only add to these that three times in the past five days women have offered to pose scantily/provocatively clad for me. I'm not a skeezy dude, they asked me, but it's kinda funny. What change in my complete lack of game caused all this? More as it develops. (oh yeah, and bike polo post soon).</description>

          <title>Always remember the super glue</title>
          <description>&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, tonight, during the course of bike polo, and well before I'd arrived, Timmy wacked the back of his head against a concrete pillar. Whe I first saw it, I thought it wasn't that bad, but after a second look, I realized the wound, while small, was all the way through the skin and really needed some kind of closure. I jokingly said I could stitch it up if we could find a needle and thread. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I do have some pretty good first aid training and experience under my belt, so when Timmy actually wanted me to stitch it up, I thought, ok, no problem, told him it would hurt, but we could do it. So we all went back to grant's house, and we got out a needle and thread, I sterilized it in bleach, and we waited for grant to get back from the store with some peroxide to clean out the wound. Before you even think it, yes, I know that peroxide robs the tissue of oxygen, but iodine is harder to get in the middle of the night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all go into the dining room and I lay down a towel and pour in the disinfectant. It's a little cut, but it really needed like two stitches to close it and keep out infection. It wasn't going to close on its own. So, I stick the needle in. It goes through with a little pushing, and then refuses to come out the other side. So I pull it out, bend the needle some more, and try again. Still no joy; the point is just too dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talk about taking him to a doc-in-a-box clinic, and Grant is looking up phone numbers when somebody brings up the possibility of super glue. I don't remember who, but I'm still kicking myself for not thinking of it before I tried to stitch him up. It's perfect for little out of the way wounds that need to be closed but can't be sutured for whatever reason (lack of insurance and sharp needles this time). So, Grant goes to the store again, gets some super glue, and the cut is fixed up better than the ER would have done in about five seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story: Don't forget the super glue.</description>

          <description>Bike polo is fun. Evidence:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Start with ladies' night</title>
          <description>&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;&quot;I have something in my nose? What?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, It's very early on friday morning, and I have about three posts in the queue. They're all vaguely about drinking, and/or bikes, and or insightful important need-to-know information. Those are the only types of posts I do, so we'll see if I can do them all in one feel swoop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Sigrid was there, writing on people's knuckles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday was the famous and ever popular ladies night at The Blue Note, and really it was a nice time. I walked in and there was Cyrus, chillin' at the bar with a new 'dew. I actually like the new hair better, even though it is a little funny to see Cyrus in a crew cut. I laughed, I admit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;For example: Reaghan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were the two drunks at the end of the bar solving the world's problems. We came to the conclusion that people are better taken individually than in groups- there's some context missing, but that's what I remembered hung over this morning. That and a lot of pretty girls. Which brings me to the next part of the story. (You people reading this should realize that this narrative has a pretty good basis in fact, but I'm glossing over the boring parts of the evening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Then Cyrus upstaged all this knuckle writing by doing his whole forearm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New girl comes over, Jordan, we meet, get to talking, and it turns out she wants to be a Suicide Girl, but needs a photographer. I was, of course, doing my normal thing, taking drunkpictures at the bar, and so she asked me if I would do it, and me being an idiot, a sucker for a pretty lady, I said sure. So it's me and Cyrus and her hanging out and drinking, and one thing leads to another, and they're kind of talking, and then I look over and they're making out. Making out pictures don't do anything for me, but I snap a few anyway, because the impulse to document is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Like I said, making out pictures don't do anything for me, but I love her surprised smile in this picture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I turn to Rachel, who was sitting at out table, and say something, chit chat like, and then Jordan says &quot;Matt!&quot; and pulls up her shirt. Reflexes and impulses being what they are, I snapped a couple frames. Demand all you want, but I'm not going to post that on the internet unless she tells me to, which is unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Does this look like a girl who would flash the camera for fun and profit? I like it, either way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there, the night is a blur of the HiLo and then to Reaghan's new abode, where there was this somewhat interesting other girl, but then everybody passed out pretty quick, and nothing happened. Her name was Kat, I'm pretty sure, and I remember her asking about my camera earlier in the night. Maybe I'll run into her again. If not, it's the bus theory of meeting women. I'll let you work that one out while I'm working on the next post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;  &gt;Walking back to my car, there was a random tractor. But that's oklahoma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeposts/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>twitter thoughts too long for twitter</title>
          <description>A conversation today on twitter got me to thinking about photography, and culture and style and art and society. There was a photographer, who shall remain nameless to protect the innocent, who's work really demonstrates all that's wrong with the world right now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photographer that brought up all these questions is a very successful commercial photographer. Very polished, styled images. There are a lot of things that I don't like about them. A lot of his images are super low contrast, with no blacks (tonality, not people) at all, while also cropping off body parts willy-nilly. His lighting also bothers me- the photos strike me as the kind you need an army of assistants (well, at least two or three) to maintain-complex and unnatural. Not every shot should be into the light, all of them can't be at golden hour, and sweat is never that perfectly placed. It's a distinctive look, but it's a plastic look, it's one I've seen a thousand times before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in a dissafected, disenfranchised society. There are the indebted, and there are the people we owe money to. The rich are few and far between, something like 5% of the population at any given time, depending on your definition of rich. Money as we think of it now has no basis in the real world, but is merely some numbers in digital domains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that, where is art? It's all gold and glam and crazy hair and tight pants. It's abstract and disconnected and complex. It's thin, insubstantial. It's going to fall apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the lack of substance that I keep coming back to in my thinking; those photographs, even of somewhat interesting subjects, were plastic and boring, stamped out of a mill of complicated lights and staged action-peaks that only look like decisive moments. They are the shiny object, to be consumed and tossed away without thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where are the real photographs, the photographers of the world as it is? I'm not talking about people wandering to far flung regions to uncover the the worst of the worst, I'm talking about the local people, the ones doing projects and reporting on local things? Where are these photographers? They're out there, I'm sure it's not just me laboring under a delusion. I know because I'm one of 'em.</description>

          <title>This one goes out to Mom</title>
          <description>Yeah, sure, sappy, I know. Go fuck yourself. My mom is in the hospital for the 13th time since September. Or was it August? I can't remember when she started dialysis, but it was around then. 3 A.V. fistulas, a peritoneal port, 6 cardiac caths, a couple infections, surgeries to install and remove the above, time for monitoring, recovering, etc, etc. She's been through a lot. And she's still not done, although it now seems that they've got a handle on why the fistulas keep failing so consistently, it's a 2% of the population kind of problem. Now she's going to rest for a couple months and they're going to do something different for a dialysis access. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;She might murder me for posting this, but oh well, at least then I won't have to worry about my student loans. This was right before they took her back for surgery today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/mom/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Home, where the laptop is</title>
          <description>&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Phil the wonderdog, and his owner Todd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it was a fairly disastrous weekend, with a few redeeming moments that made the trip to Austin just shy of a total waste. So I blogged about Thursday evening, and then took my laptop into the kitchen for some browsing and conversation. I plugged in the laptop so it could charge, and then when I got up I tripped over the cord and knocked it onto the floor, breaking the screen. So, sans laptop, I didn't blog or process pictures the rest of the weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Steves was there, somewhat improbably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That afternoon, there was an alley cat and a movie premiere. I got DFL in the alley cat, and saw half the movie, which looked pretty good, and then decided to strike out towards the action. There were free drinks somewhere, I could smell them. Come to think of it, that might have been the empty beer in my hand. Oh well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The bikes piled up before the alleycat. Yay dfl!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, my luck was a little better. We got in to a party with free tequila, but then, standing in a long line waiting for drinks, Sarah decdided to go see Devo, who I don't care about, and so we all left the party with the free booze and I went and walked sixth street for a couple hours while they were at the show. That's where I saw the coolest thing of the whole trip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a guy standing between two van de graaff (lightning) generators, all covered in chainmail. The lightning striking him was modulated so that the lightning was a speaker. The lightning noise was the music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;F'ing amazing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there, I wandered until my feet hurt, then sat a little, then wandered a little, in a &quot;diminishing returns&quot; situation until I was walking a block and sitting on a curb for five minutes, and then getting up and moving along. Somewhere in there was pizza and a coke. Then Devo was over, and everyone went back to the party with the free drinks, where, after I'd had one beer and one shot of tequila, they ran out of booze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the house to sleep, only to wake up in the morning to no computer and no internets. Saturday was half-decent DJ's during the day followed by a rather nice evening hanging with Todd (my host, remember) and his girlfriend Kelli. Fairly interesting people, the both of them. Todd really really needs to show his paintings in a gallery. I know people, professional art people (gallery people), who would kill for paintings like his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Oh yeah, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.furburger.org&quot;&gt;cmay&lt;/a&gt; was there too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday morning, we woke up and drove back. Contained in that sentence was another highlight of the trip- driving north on I-35, big puffy clouds overhead, radiohead on the stereo, and finally, for a little while, everything was right with the world. Now I'm home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;People at the &quot;Mess with Texas&quot; show right next to the capitol. This was a nice moment when I was sitting on a rock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sxswlast/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>SXSW update....</title>
          <description>So we're still here, still haven't seen any shows, and if it weren't for our gracious and intelligent host, we wouldn't even have had and free beer. Austin is really going to have to kick it up a notch to save itself from this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Beginning of the night, all dressed up, still hopeful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to the party 45 minutes early and there was already a line a couple hundred people long. For some reason, when you tell people free beer and hot DJ's, they line up like it's the cure for stupidity. And then stand there. For two hours. While people cut, and get to go in vip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;On the way, the night looked promising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to me it's an intelligence test. It sounds like a good idea to go stand in line for a little while and get a bunch of free shit- booze, music, hot, scantily clad women etc. There's a limit to how much you can stand there though, and here's where the intelligence test comes in: the smarter you are, the sooner you leave. When we left, there were still 200 people standing in line, not about to get in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The line, when we got there. Seemed like we'd get in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, they were at capacity when they stopped letting people in, I'm sure. But after a bunch of people leave, why not let the people at the front of the line in? Instead, they were only allowing VIP's, which unfortunately, we're not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;The same line, 45 minutes later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we gave up after about an hour of just standing there. In our defense, there were maybe 20 people in front of us; it seemed possible, when they said they were at capacity, that we might get in after some people left. Then we came back to the house, (Todd's house) and drank beer and talked late into the night with todd, todd's friend who works for SNL, and his girlfriend, who's name I've forgotten. Longtime blogreaders and friends will know this is because I'm horrible with names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;This was as far as we got. Then we gave up and commenced drinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/night2sxsw/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>day 1 sxsw</title>
          <description>Today has kinda been a blur... there was morning coffee, burritos, american appearal factory seconds sale, walking around, biking around, whole foods, lots of music, lost of fun. And I haven't even had any free beer yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/day1sxsw/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>In austin. on a couch.</title>
          <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, throwing yourself at the mercy of the universe occasionally does work out. I'm on a couch here in Austin, TX, mere miles from downtown and the famous and ever popular SXSW music fest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole journey started this morning, when Sarah twittered about going to SXSW today, to catch some band. So I called her and asked if she could delay an extra half hour, to give me time to get my shit together ( I thought we were leaving tomorrow). She told me she didn't really have shit together either, and so I had time, meet at her house, and everything would be cool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took for-ev-er to get out of OKC though- one thing after another kept going wrong, or errands that should have taken just a few minutes took an hour, and on and on. It was like the karmic forces of the city didn't want to let us go. Finally, after something like 2 hours of running around, we were ready to go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drive down was good- there was a nice sunset, some McD's, a little nap, and not a few pictures. I drove the last 40 minutes, and after a couple tries, parallel parked the car on an off street east of downtown. We got on our bikes, and not two minutes later were yelled at by some cops. Nice job austin PD, making people new in town feel welcome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, jetting away from that situation (nice thing about bikes in a city- there's little chance for someone in a car to catch you), we found ourselves right in the middle of the maddness, on the mainline, we hit the central nerve, etc, etc. Only to be greeted by a sign outside all the official venues: no photography without a press pass. Bullshit I say. The good news is that for the most part we're going to be frequenting unofficial parties and venues; apparently that's where the best parts are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went from there to the long branch, which was a cool little joint. Nice atmos, good music, interesting clientele (if you could call them that). I had a couple beers, and that (and a short ride back to the car, and a short car ride) brings me to the present tense. Oh yeah, and there's a crazy jumpy dog in the house we're staying at. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/toaustin/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <description>FYI, she's staring at tanner trying to track stand and chug beers. Tanner was able to get three without a foot down, but that photo just looks like a dude chugging beer on a bike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/coupleportraits/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim, all dressed up at the party. Martini: extra dirty. Suit: extra sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/coupleportraits/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Lock, back in town for the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/coupleportraits/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Three guys play some music</title>
          <description>Ended up at sauced friday, and didn't have time to post these yesterday. some people might say that makes me a bad blogger, but they need to get a life. The band is called, I think, The Double Clutchers. I could tell they were having fun, not a bad sound, but a lot of covers. I enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This girl is not a member of the band. Rule of thumb: stripes = trouble. She's not wearing paisley, that's all I'm sayin'. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/threeguys/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Openbeta2</title>
          <description>Last night was openbeta, and it was actually a really cool interesting event. I'm not just saying that, you know; a lot of talks and conferences bore the shit out of me, and I just leave in the middle of them. OK, so I stepped out for a smoke in the middle of one of the boring lightning talks, but other than that, it was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Grant, giving his demo of Twircl, which still hasn't launched, but is by far the coolest thing I've seen one of my friends come up with since art school. Twircl is a direct group messaging app that runs on top of twitter, something that the system  needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the wimgo girls, and, well, do I really need to say anything. Thanks for the pen, ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant kills 'em with his presentation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/openbeta2/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voltron Presents: Why they're awesome.

          <title>Pictures until I was too drunk to focus</title>
          <description>By which I actually mean there are more photos, and some of them are in focus, but after the last one here (which we'll pretend was intentional), I was walking the fine line between blackout and just stupid, and so none of those photos are any good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm actually not sure any of these are any good, but they're kind of fun, at least. That's the threshold these days for blog-worthy photos, if I think someone I know will get a laugh or like it or link or somesuch, then I'll put it up. Actually, there's a quality threshold as well, see paragraph 1 for example. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday was a pretty epic night, and actually it's a good thing, because my money's just about run out again. Time to find another jobby job. I did a pretty good job of embarrassing myself in front of girls I barely know, and some old friends in the mix too. It's strange, the way things run in circles sometimes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've never seen a look on Cyrus's face like the one below, but it's probably always there under the surface- a sort of laughing incredulity. Either that or it's drunkface and I'm reading too much into a picture.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reagan always makes the best photo-faces. It's like she's screaming &quot;I&quot;M REAGAN&quot; with her whole face. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here's the old friends I was talking about- Chase and Brian- I've known Brian since high school. He'll probably get pissed and send me more death threats, but that's a risk I'm willing to take to bring everyone quality photos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this pic, for some ineffable reason. I know, I know. Shoot me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/drunkface/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <description>Shooting in a bit of a different mode yesterday. With the digital camera. Decided film was too expensive. So sue me. I don't think the look suffers that much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how even the McD's sign is screwed up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I talk about this project, people bring up the tower theatre; looking at the fron of it, I wonder if it wouldn't be easier to just build a new one in the vacant lot across the street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/23rdday3/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shooting yesterday wasn't as good, as fulfilling as is was the first couple outings; I thought, walking back, that I might just give up the project and move on. But it seems like I'm onto something; the dilapidation there is a symptom of the wider economic problems. I can't tell if it's getting worse or better. Also, I look at the pictures, see I'm doing good work, and can hardly stop myself.</description>

          <title>Momentum Artshow</title>
          <description>Momentum 09 was last night, and I was really surprised by the quality and scope and size and attendance of the show. It was packed, the work was 75% good, all stuff I'm not used to seeing in this town, and it filled a freaking warehouse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a lot of big open installations, a lof of big cool paintings, some shit photos (sorry everyone, but the photo showing this year just wasn't that great, with a few notable exceptions). Hving these clouds right by the entrance set the mood for the place: it was as if someone took a piece of a real art scene out of the air of New York or Santa Fe and stuck it here in oak city, improbably and strangely. So it seemed natural to see a crib full of beer bongs and a whole room of homoerotic black fraternity induction paintings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was my friend Bobby's band, playing a pretty rad live set. If they'd had a cd available, I'd have bought one, and that's not something I do a lot. These kids know how to rock. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0011.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0012.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0013.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was this womblike installation in what used to be a woman's restroom. It was completely transformed and amazing; all it needed was some giant pillows on the floor and some mild hallucinogenic gas in the air and it would have been perfect.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0014.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't know what to think of the deer. But I like the photo, so sue me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0015.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some MC, not all that great. Nobody's perfect, maybe he was havin' an off night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0016.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was the after after after party, which was really about four people in Jim's apartment eating cheese and drinking french wine. I'd like to say it was a nice end to the night, but there were a couple fights on the lawn that complicated things. So instead it was kind of a haggard exhausted end to the evening, but at least it was in good company.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0017.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Some random photos:</title>
          <description>There's a post about momentum coming, but to tide everyone over until I can get that together, here's some photos from earlier in the week. Francois, on wednesday: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray-guns, at McNellie's:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cody at blue note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was one of those nights where I was the drunk one. Not as drunk as some people, though, and that turned out to be a good thing. I told Sarah early on in the night that I'd make sure she got home alright. She did, and I crashed on her couch.  My good deed for the week done, I give you the morning after:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/momentum/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More in a few minutes, when I get the real momentum post together.</description>

          <title>Candid Portraits for Hire</title>
          <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is a New Idea. At least, I think it's new, and if it isn't, well, I don't know anybody that does it. The idea is, a lot of people like to have good pictures of their family; in fact, this is the only thing a lot of people care to have pictures of. But studio pictures from places like walmart or sears or even glamour shots suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead of a studio, what about the home? And instead of a quick grin-and-grab, what about spending some time with the family, say two hours- over dinner, maybe, or an afternoon in the park? Candid pictures the whole time, and give the family digital copies that they can do whatever they want with? If they want to order prints through me, that's fine, but I'd rather make money shooting than printing, so that's where the charges come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures here in this post were shot in the space of about an hour and a half; These aren't all of the keepers, just enough for a teaser. I ended up sending the family 25 images in all, all of which I was happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if anyone is interested in this being done with their family, just drop me a line at my email, rates are negotiable, and depend on how much and what you want me to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantsfambp/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Perspectives? More like Photos</title>
          <description>Last night was portrait night, or a really wild ass night, or a depressing fucker, or a wild debauch, all depending on your perspective. Crying girls, a night in the drunk tank, someone got neck punched, someone else got shot down, couple people got laid (I assume), someone went 59mph on rollers, it goes on and on. Me, I took it mellow, took some pictures, and passed out on a couch. I'm feeling lazy, so here's photos. If you want more details, call someone who knows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/shotdown/0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>Crane go Boom</title>
          <description>Crane accident at the Dean Mcgee Eye institute's new construction. No injuries reported at this time, however the operator did have to call home for a spare pair of pants to be brought to the site. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3355/3306731606_bfd2c0d70d_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it's a good thing that nobody got hurt, and I can't help but think it's probably a indicator of good procedure somewhere that nobody was stupid enough to be underneath the running crane. As for the causes, could be operator error, could be equipment malfunction, I don't know. Five minutes from now it'll be old news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My dad (a pipe weldor with ~40 years on construction sites) tells me that it was almost definitely operator error. The main line was pulled too tight, the cable snapped, everything jumps and goes slack, at which point the lack of tension causes the jib to fall. It was a huge stroke of luck, according to dad, that the crane came down in an empty area, and also that the operator is alive.</description>

          <title>your camera does matter</title>
          <description>OK, so I'm tired of all this bullshit on the web about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/notcamera.htm&quot;&gt;your camera doesn't matter&lt;/a&gt;, no need for that 4000 dollar setup, etc. Then there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNK2603NP5A00POX&quot;&gt;this crap&lt;/a&gt; (which I got via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kottke.org/09/02/a-poor-photographer-blames-his-tools&quot;&gt;kottke&lt;/a&gt;, a pretty good blog usually) about how the old masters, those before autofocus and autoexposure had it about the same as anyone with a point and shoot. The photographers he mentions for the most part shot with Leicas, cameras renowned for their speed, quality, and ability to work in low light even with the ISO 400 films of the time. (The author of that piece confuses old color emulsions, which were very slow, with black and white, which have been reasonable since the mid nineteen thirties). Henri Cartier-Bresson, one of my personal heroes, whom he mentions by name, was famous for almost always using a 50mm f/2 lens and ISO 400 Tri-x, moderately fast film with incredible tonalities possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not saying it's impossible to make good photos with cheap or lesser cameras. I'm even using some of the shots from my old G9 in the book I'm trying to produce. But telling people to buck up and try harder in the face of the crap that is the consumer camera market right now, well, that's bullshit. The factors that are comparable are not the important ones to photographers. The important things are all related to creative control and perspective. The reason little digital cameras mostly suck is you have little control over how the thing sees; it's very hard to fit your vision into a little screen. Here's a list of the things that do matter, though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Format size. This comes before every other consideration, as it is a defining characteristic of how the camera will work, its weight, how the image is printed, how depth of field is established, all sorts of things. Bigger gives higher technical image quality, and smaller means better ease of use. My personal choice is the 24x36mm rectangle- a good balance between optical and tonal qualities and the ability to move around. Notice I say here &quot;format&quot; and not &quot;megapixels&quot;; the difference being that format is very important and megapixels aren't anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Shutter Lag. THIS WAS ALMOST NUMBER ONE. That's because it's so often overlooked and it's perhaps the most important to the most photographers (potential and actual). A camera's shutter lag needs to be small, less than one tenth of a second, for it to be remotely useful in getting a moment, which for me is all of photography. Most crappy (P&amp;S) cameras, you could press the shutter button, go have lunch, come back, start a pot of coffee for the afternoon, and then, finally, the camera will make the exposure. Completely unacceptable. In most old manual cameras, this wasn't a problem, because the mechanical path from the shutter to the button was short and fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Focal Length. You may say that for a given photographer, they will have many lenses, but many tend toward one end of the spectrum or another- James Nachtwey uses wide angles a lot, Cartier-Bresson preferred the fifty (normal in his preferred 35mm format), paparazzi live and die by their telephoto lenses, and if you ask ten photographers, you'll get ten answers, all unique. I'm a normal and wider kind of photographer, 50 and 20. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Minimum F/stop- This determines the most amount of light that the lens can allow to pass through. I cart around a huge honking 50mm f/1.2, which gathers light somewhat akin to a radio telescope collecting signal, but that's because I work in dark rooms with sketchy nonexistent lighting a lot. For most people, f/2 is plenty for most situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so for most point and shoots, the lenses suck, the format sucks, the viewing sucks, and the shutter lag is longer than a smoke break. It's a miracle these things make pictures at all. You almost have to be a savant to get anything good out of them. To the people out there that know better, please stop bullshitting amateurs into thinking that their camreras are capable machines, because more than likely the machine sucks and they haven't a hope of getting better with it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- Ken Rockwell, while being a little odd a lot of the time, has a lot of good smart things to say about photography and cameras, so long as you know he's joking half of the time. The other guy makes some good points, too, but really, if the camera didn't matter, we'd all be painters. Now go take some pictures.</description>

          <title>Sunday Sunday Sunday</title>
          <description>Today was a good day in paradise. Started out sleeping in a bit, then went to brunch/coffee/movie with Lori:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brunch we were going to go to (the guatemalan on classen) is closed sundays, or at least it was closed today, so we went to cafe do brasil, where I got my chorizo fix over eggs and a side of Mimosa. Coffee at coffeeslingers, mostly to kill time, and then onto the movie, Taken, which was awesome- the most realistic fight scenes I can recall in a movie. Brutal, fast paced, and it could've ended about five minutes before it did. No need to sugar coat the ending, Hollywood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, with Lori off to study something boring, I was free to go shoot golden hour on 23rd street. I had to go around twice to get the photo of the capitol. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These same people are always hanging out on that bench in the corner. I don't know if they live in the apartments out of frame to the left or they're homeless and that's just their spot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homage to Eugene Atget. Wig shop. It was always a little but of a surprise to hit the end of a roll so quickly; about half an hour walking and 141 pictures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0005.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0006.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0007.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0008.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0009.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/sundayx3/0010.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I walked from Robinson to Classen, dropped off the four rolls I'd shot at Walgreens, and went to grab a bite while they were being run. I have my doubts about the usability of these photo cd scans; fine for web, but I'm going to need to scan them better to make prints. Might just not bother next time and scan everything at home. Then again it does make blogging a lot easier.</description>

          <title>Lacking the will to blog</title>
          <description>Right now, I should tell the story of the excellent day I had shooting with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeremycharles.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Charles&lt;/a&gt;, or rather him shooting and me assisting, but I think I can may be just say that it was a good time, picked up a few new tricks for my lighting bag, and it was nice to be able to talk to someone about photography who's been where I'm at and receive a little encouragement. Also, I had a moment to grab a few photos of the first band, who's name I forget. This is why I usually take notes of these things. Anyway, Photos (now with black borders!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/assisting/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/assisting/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/assisting/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/assisting/0004.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>Why I quit my job/ What Happened today</title>
          <description>So, it's been a long ass day. I got up and I was sore from a fall last night, I'm still stiff, actually, but that's another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got up and went to work, and for once I was pretty on time, or at least I was there earlier than the other two people in my office. I go back to the processor to turn it on, and there were a couple pieces out of it, so I opened the lid and took a look at the tanks, and the rinse baths were a bit frothy. If you know anything about processors, or about photography in general, It's not a good thing for your rinse baths to be opaque, and also not a good thing for them to be frothy. The froth turned out to be rinse aid, which is strange and unnecessary, but whatever. I digress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I see the processor in this state and I'm a little upset. You've got to understand, this is a quarter of a mil sitting there let to rot. Not only that, but the utility of it, its ability to make prints, was seriously degraded. Maybe I'm crazy. But I was a little pissed. So, I tell everyone we really need to drain and clean the machine, and then we can get back to printing, it'll take a day, but the prints will be better and the machine won't in danger of breaking down imminently. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As background, I've worked on these machines before, and I have a pretty intimate understanding of the chemistry involved. If you want, you can look it up, I'm not in the mood to explain it here. There's no need for the rinse aid in the final baths, because the prints are dired with hot air right away. Which I tried to explain to the office manager (or whatever keith is), but he wasn't having any of it. By this time I'd been to get cleaning supplies, pulled the rinse bath rollers, and cleaned the first set. I put the machine back together and went outside for a smoke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm outside, then, with one of the other people I work with, Haley (not Luna). Keith, the office manager, comes over and starts talking about the machine, and I try to explain to him that really the machine should be thouroughly cleaned once a month, and he goes off on me. Says he just got off the phone with some so-and so from tech support who told him it only needed it every six months, and moreover my experience didn't matter because I'd never worked on this machine, and I said to him, fine, let's just let it drop, no reason to be angry. So he yells at me some more, and I tell him to let it go some more, and seemed like about ten times we went back and fourth like that, and finally I tell him, fine, find another photographer. And I turned on my heel and grabbed my shit and I was gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I've had a pretty chill day. I went to sauced and had some coffee, shot some photos for the 23rd st project (coming soon, next post, I swear), and built a bike for a pretty girl. The girl is attached to a guy, but sometimes it's nice to build something just because you can, because it's something positive in an otherwise shit day. Maybe the photos are good though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you know anyone looking for an experienced photographer, photo assistant, fine printer, entry-level web programmer, locksmith, or portugese translator, I'm available.</description>

          <title>First day of 23rd st. Project</title>
          <description>So today was the first day of working on the 23rd street project; just a walk up and down with my leica to see what I saw, and to try to get a handle on what the project would and could be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstday23rdst/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as I was walking and talking to Grant, I was also thinking. Grant graciously came along to watch my back. I have this tendency to concentrate so much on what I'm photographing that I walk out into the road to get the right angle, and not notice oncoming cars. So it's good to have someone along who isn't trying to line up things visually, much less conceptualize a new project at the same time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstday23rdst/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project as I see it now can go a couple of ways; I can see it happening fairly quickly, couple weeks of work, but the idea, the interesting thing to me thus far, is that 23rd street is the border between two really distinct neighborhoods, and that contrast causes all this crazy activity, lots of bums, shops, empty storefronts, crazy shit. It's a busy area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstday23rdst/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But also there's the possibility of following the street for a while, six months to a year, to see what happens, because as midtown wraps up to the south and paseo continues to develop to the north, there's no way all these buildings will stay run down; they're going to become prime real estate soon; it's already happening to a few little strips. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstday23rdst/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of this photo essay as a series of intense contrasts; the tension between the neighborhoods from the north and the south, the new shops and their new customers and the old bums and winos and just the plain residents (somehoe nobody has yet targeted the down-and-out demographic, except maybe Byron's liquor). It's probably an avenue I'll pursue (or at least be thinking about while I'm shooting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/firstday23rdst/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add: Film scanning is a bitch. I think I'm probably going to just shoot this with my canon digi, just to save myself the hassle and the expense of film. OK, croudsource an answer: what do you think? Is the film look in the above pics worth the hassle? (shitty scans, I know; part of the cost would be a new scanner).</description>

          <title>Fucker</title>
          <description>So yesterday was a fucker of a day. After I said all that about loving life on the road and how I'd rather be doing my job than carousing and womanizing and drinking (still basically true), I had a fucker of an afternoon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was made worse by the fact that I had a great morning- I was shooting really well, not too tired or too sore in the shoulders. Well, there was a bit of technical difficulty at the beginning (I had changed my manual ip to try to get my comp working on their network, and voila, it worked, but then the guys out front couldn't connect to me. Never mind they could've found me in the network browser). But being a little pissed just sharpened me up, and I hit all the marks just right. That I also have to make up the marks as I go, or rather intuit them (an important philosophical difference, but we have to many parentheticals already) makes no difference.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/fromtheroad/leonardsign.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the afternoon came. Groups of dancers, first duo/trios, and then gradually increasing until there were 30 on the floor. So, just as we were getting into the groups of 6-8, one of the pins bent in on my card reader and I was in trouble. So, I sent the guys out front, my boss, an IM asking for help. I get no response, and in short order I had worked through my extra cards. So, I ran out to their area, and in the process, missed a dance routine. Threw me off the rest of the afternoon. Got heated there for a second and I was tempeted to walk off from the whole thing, but my better nature prevailed, and I'm still employed. that is, they didn't fire me for a mistake, and I didn't walk off mad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then dinner, and my boss was in hot water for us leaving &quot;early.&quot; Early being maybe 15 minutes to beat the crowd. Oh well, now nobody in the  whole crew gives a shit, we're only doing this job for the money anyway. Why won't people figure out that giving subordinates shit just pisses them off and gets you less work, of lower quality? Foster a good work environment, and good things happen. Positive reinforcement. When your buisiness depends on creative people, all that bad emotion can really fuck up their day, which in turn screws your product. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough rambling, back to work for me.</description>

          <title>Up too early</title>
          <description>Why am I awake at this ungodly hour? It's saturday morning. I should be drunk, passed out with my arms around some beautiful woman I don't deserve. I should have partied all night with my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I'm here in a town in north carolina in a town who's name I can't spell right (albamarle? albermar? something). Today, I'm going to go and sit in a chair for hours on end, and take pictures. This instead of waking up with said woman, making breakfast and nursing a hangover all day, orange juice, eggs, coffee, maybe a mid-afternoon bike ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, today I'll shoot more than 10,000 pictures. I'll hear the same 50 songs repeated about twice, some more than others, and some more annoyingly than others (I never did like Annie). I'll hold up the 5 pound camera setup for most of that time, a 12-13 hour day, with a short break for lunch. I'll be exhausted and ache at the end and probably have one dinner choice, because everything else in town shuts down at 8. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strangest part? I prefer this to staying at home. I'd rather be out here on the edge of what I can do, busting my ass, trying to do something nearly impossible (produce good art on demand, several hundred times in a day? that's so absurd it's beyond consideration, but here we are). This is difficult, but it's the life I've been missing out on in a lot of ways, going different places, doing photography, a little suffering but much joy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the people in what I'm already thinking of as my old life, there's nothing I miss. With the exception of the hypothetical pretty lady, who 9/10ths of the time I'm texting from the road anyway. What's wrong with me?</description>

          <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, i kind of wasn't going to blog this, it being old news and all, but I wanted to at least share the pictures. Funny story: for the pictures of everybody crouded together in the bathroom, that was for the second cell that passed over us, the one that wasn't really anything to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first day in the office was actually good. Doing sysadin-like duties already, although I don't really think I qualify for the title yet. Or at least I was doing them until the power went out. Point for twitter- I found out about the storm a little ahead of everyone else on twitter. Then I sat there for twenty minutes trying to find decent radar coverage (not really possible on the internet, unless you get a live feed from the tv stations, which is easier to get from, say, a TV).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tornado/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>a weekend in kentucky</title>
          <description>So I started my new job for reals last weekend, and it was strange, like everything else in my life. The traveling was some of the easiest I've done. Nothing went wrong (in an unfixable way, at least). Like I said, the things that are usually difficult, like morning coffee or lunch, were handled with ease. For those not in the know: my new job is taking pictures of dance competitions. to the tune of 20k images a weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/louisville/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard part wasn't really taking the photos, either, although I can tell already that my timing and camera handling is going to get a lot better (this coming from someone who didn't think that was possible). This is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/louisville/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(There was some bs here that I cut out, because some shit shouldn't see the light of day. not while it's half baked at least. suffice to say that dance competitions are hard to fit into my worldview; they are, in a word, problematic). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/louisville/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, the girls probably mostly have a great time dancing, and enjoy having quality pictures of what they love doing. I can dig on that. Thinking of it that way, it's hard to hold onto my objections. At the end of the day, I'm a professional. I do the job, nobody gets hurt because of it, maybe some people enjoy what I produce even. That's fine with me.</description>

          <title>The abbreviated quest for coffee</title>
          <description>So I woke up at about 4:30 this morning, local time. I sat around for a little bit, then decided to get my ass in gear and shower and clean off two days of road dirt and sleep. Every time I needed something, there it was in my bag. Even Q-tips, even my phone charger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, fresh, dressed, I pulled out my laptop and read a bunch of feeds, all the usual blogs. At this point I thought I'd try to go and find coffee, usually an exercise frought with difficulty not least because of my level of awareness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/abbrcoffee/0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out the room door and down the stairs of the convenient downtown hotel. and into the lobby. I already knew that the continental breakfast didn't start until 7am on saturday (seriously, the majority of travel is business and on the weekend; some people have to be out the door earlier). I had little hope, then, of finding coffee in the lobby. I found the usual breakfast nook empty, per expectations, but as I was snapping a photo of it, the desk clerk came around the corner and I asked her: Where can I get coffee?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/abbrcoffee/0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That angel, that wonderful woman, told me that she was making it right then, that it would be out momentarily. F'ing amazing. So I stood around for a minute or two, then she came back with an airpot. Awesome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's this trip so far in a nutshell. I'm a professional working with professionals. Everybody's doing their job, there haven't been any disasters yet. (As I type that I knock the wood of the desk). And today, I get to the best part; for six or eight hours, I'm going to sit in a chair and take pictures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not enough; I'm still gonna have to push my own work, keep making my own pictures, but it's a start. I think I'm gonna like this job.</description>

          <title>Rushing out the door</title>
          <description>First off, I'm writing this in a bit of a rush, scratching off that last to do item from my list before I hit the door. The Regular Wednesday sesh was a lot of fun; not only did we hit the litter box, but we rode around and hit some spots as well. Down by the chase building, a little bricktown love, and then we rocked up the monster hill. It's the only monster in town, another sign that OKC isn't a real city. Anyway, photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/wedsesh/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how everyone's starting to get the no handed shit down pat, or at least look good for the thirtieth of a second I need to get the photos. Nice to see hornbeck in town, too, and on his new whip no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, that's all folks, I'm out. I'm going to try to shoot and post from the road, we'll see how well that works. I'll be twittering, at least. On the flip side.</description>

          <title>dream jobs</title>
          <description>no time to post thouroughly, but topic for later: why the hell aren't we doing our dream jobs? Or busting ass to work towards them? Not allowed to use the words &quot;in these difficult economic times&quot; or anything of the like. The time to do that shit is now, easy or hard. </description>

          <description>But the volume knob &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulsboutique.beastieboys.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is pretty badass. Actually yesterday I was talking mad shit on flash for web design because it usually sucks and just does the same stuff that you can do faster and better in javascript... but this I have no idea how I'd do, and it's a cool effect.</description>

          <title>New Furniture...</title>
          <description>So I got a new couch today, courtesy of Grant (hi grant). The best way to get me to clean is to move furniture, and/or get new furniture. Something about rearranging everything makes me want to organize all my crap and throw away all the various detritus I collect over time. So, after sleeping through the super bowl, I started to work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The room actually seemed to get worse for the first couple hours, so I paused, laid on the new loveseat and listened to tom waits, which for some reason motivated me. &lt;span &gt;Nighthawks at the Diner&lt;/span&gt; for anyone who cares. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't throw away all of my junk; I'm enough of a romantic that some stuff I keep around for sentimental value alone. I have bits and pieces of most of the cameras I've owned over the years for example. The ones that weren't stolen, that is. Certain pictures, too, I just can't part with or throw away prints of, even if they're a little damaged. The tech stuff I'm pretty good about trashing once it's past its prime. So, because it's such a rare occurrence, I give you my room, as clean as it gets:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/clean_room.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also yesterday, I had my first gig with Take Two productions, and let me say it's nice to work with professionals. I was running the wider of the two video cameras, something I've never done before (all my video experience has been single-camera work, documentary, and as cheap as possible). It took me a few numbers, but I got the hang of it. It didn't help that I was on an hour and a half of sleep; I probably would have been a bit quicker on the uptake, a little smoother, if I had been able to sleep saturday night. Or at night at all; It's 5am and my super nap ended around 9pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I might end up preferring to run video on these gigs, given that I get more work from take 2; there's less pressure. We'll see. I haven't done stills for them yet, and I'd like to try that too; It's more in my bones to do stills. This site isn't &quot;videographermattmills&quot; for a reason. Anyway, my newly clean and cleared bed is calling my name.</description>

          <title>cmay's party, then some booze cruise</title>
          <description>Last night I went to Royal Bavaria for Christa May's birthday. Christa is the evil genius behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://furburger.org&quot;&gt;Furburger&lt;/a&gt;  for those that don't know. It was a fun time, except the service sucked.  And I was off my game, not that many good photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then We all headed into the city, ostensibly to go sing Karaoke at the Celebrity Club (no celebrities there though). They were at capacity, so I headed over to the rooster, caught up with booze cruise (which didn't cruise that much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we moved on to a house party, Cody and Steve's new spot:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Girl Was madly in love with her board:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cody trying to pass out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you tell that's the same bed Cody was in? Can you guess what's going on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's all good in the end. Or at least it was when I was leaving:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/cmayparty/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then home, to sleep for 12 hours. Whenever I sleep dep, the crash is the best part. I'm guessing that's why I wasn't shooting that great, I was exhausted from not sleeping much, just a couple naps in a couple days really. Anyway, it's time to ride again.</description>

          <title>The $3 Cure for Cabin Fever</title>
          <description>yesterday, after far too long inside the house, I drove downtown for three dollar burgers at Mcnellie's with a bunch of people. Ended up being nine or ten of us, crowded around a table for 7, but it was good. Delicious food and friends and some photos were just what the doctor ordered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, I think I'm going to spend the better part of tonight folding paper. The maquette is printed, I just have to fold everything and sew it together. Oh yeah, and cut up the last few photos. Speaking of photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/3dollaburger/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <title>no way they're really thinking about this in oklahoma</title>
          <description>in response to some stuff on facebook, about nuclear power in oklahoma, and maybe putting it somewhere out in the desert:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the problem is nuclear waste stays dangerous for 10,000 plus years. We're talking geologic time here. There's barely anything manmade left from 10000 years ago, much less a solid intact structure. It's a fool's gambit to put this stuff in a salt mine or inside a mountain because any number of unforeseen events could leak the waste into the biosphere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the waste is only a small part of the overall problem of radioactivity. People talk about Chernobyl and Three mile island as if they were the only nuclear accidents to ever happen, but actually they happen more frequently than you'd like to think. see &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for more examples, although I'm sure that list is incomplete. These are built by the lowest bidder, remember. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Support in the short term&quot; is like saying ok, a little poison is all right. This stuff is so toxic (before, during and after use) that we build ten foot concrete walls around it, then put more security and perimeters around that, and then beyond that is a line where you don't have to wear a dosimeter any more. There are workers in some facilities who can never leave, because they themselves were irradiated so much that they are toxic to the outside world. (I have a feeling that they don't last long like this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit to add: &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsok.com/proponents-make-case-for-nuclear-in-oklahoma/article/3336983&quot;&gt;the article from the oklahoman&lt;/a&gt;. Seems there aren't any real plans, just some legislators getting their panties in a bunch. 8 to ten years until they become operational is another problem for an &quot;interim&quot; solution.</description>

          <title>I should be working on the blook</title>
          <description>And applying for jobs and trying my hardest to come up with the zillions of dollars I owe some silly people who think they're ever going to get any money out of me. As I'm pretty sure I'm never going to get any money out of me, what chance have they got?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there is a final final edit of pics for the blook, just under fifty pictures, and they're in a sort-of order, so I'm going to mock that shit up and print it off and see what people say. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, some lame pictures for your ass:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nothing/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/nothing/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, super boring, because the last week was all shot to hell between being in the hospital with my mom's multiple operations and my stomach flu. Isn't the dog cute though? I promise to get out more and take photos this week. Now, page design!</description>

          <title>too true</title>
          <description>via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/01/economic_distre.html&quot;&gt;Schneirer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Part of the debtor mentality is a constant, frantically suppressed undercurrent of terror. We have one of the highest debt-to-income ratios in the world, and apparently most of us are two paychecks from the street. Those in power -- governments, employers -- exploit this, to great effect. Frightened people are obedient -- not just physically, but intellectually and emotionally. If your employer tells you to work overtime, and you know that refusing could jeopardize everything you have, then not only do you work the overtime, but you convince yourself that you're doing it voluntarily, out of loyalty to the company; because the alternative is to acknowledge that you are living in terror. Before you know it, you've persuaded yourself that you have a profound emotional attachment to some vast multinational corporation: you've indentured not just your working hours, but your entire thought process. The only people who are capable of either unfettered action or unfettered thought are those who -- either because they're heroically brave, or because they're insane, or because they know themselves to be safe -- are free from fear.&lt;br /&gt;Quote is from The Likeness, a novel set in Ireland, by Tana French.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny that this wholly logical analysis is an old zen idea- that true mastery of any art (and thereby life itself) is freedom from fear. It's particularly apropos because I'm getting about 5 calls a day from various debt collectors with delusions that I have the ability to pay them. Man I need a real job.</description>

          <description>I don't know about everybody else, but this looks more like Charlie Chaplin than anything else:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantshouse/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purse, it went so well with his shoes, he just had to try it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantshouse/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I'm too lazy to caption the rest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantshouse/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantshouse/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantshouse/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantshouse/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantshouse/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/grantshouse/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot;/&gt;</description>

          <title>Silly Rabbit, Tricks are for bikes</title>
          <description>So, I've been a little lax in posting photos the last few days. Chalk it up to new year depression. January always gets me down, and it takes a few days for all the old habits to kick in and pull me out of my funk. It's been a good couple of days though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah and Damaris see the green fairy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm officially a pedicab driver: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that the other new job, the one where I'm officially a professor, and it couldn't get more ridiculous. Unless of course you're Steves with a tablecloth on your face:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The litter box session was pretty good too:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next night, at the ever popular 3020:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0012.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karaoke at the raintree:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0013.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last one comes with a public service announcement. There is a reason Old Milwaukee is so cheap. Do not try to play asshole with that shit unless you're prepared for a monster hangover. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/tricksareforbikes/0014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;</description>

          <description>The handprint was from the night before; this is early afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That snake on his head really rattled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the parrot didn't talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim rocks out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man needs no front wheels, I swear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/justanothersatnight/0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sirens of OKC?

          <title>send me work please</title>
          <description>because, well, my camera is starting to go bad. The LCD has been sketchy for months, and now the mode dial doesn't work right- it will just change modes at random. I'm going to have to buy a new one. I've got a nikon d700 in mind. Camera plus a new 50mm lens plus batteries equals 2700 bucks, give or take, from B&amp;H. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best way you could help me is maybe if you know someone that has photography needs, maybe you could let them know you just saw this awesome photographer on the web (for those who don't know me personally) or you know this guy who's a really awesome photographer (for those who do). I'm $500 a day (plus expenses, large travel costs have to be up front at this point) for most kinds of work, minimum half day charge unless it's a one shot deal like a headshot. The general rule is if I shoot for an hour, I'm editing for two, and there's half the day shot by the time I burn files to a disk or send them via ftp or whatever. I can still do work with the camera, and if I could get a couple assignments, I could manage a new one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I've added a donation button over to one side, too. if anybody feels inclined to donate to the cause, feel free. I'm not about to stop doing what I'm doing, unless the camera really does die. in that case, I'll bleg some more.</description>

          <description>Rather than bog down your connections and make you all hate me, I made a special gallery for the photos: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/decbirthdaygallery.html&quot;&gt;just click this finely crafted link to be taken there&lt;/a&gt;. Really really wild night though.</description>

          <title>Why 35?</title>
          <description>Yes, Virginia, there really is a reason the 36x24mm rectangle is magic. It is a simple as three words- depth of field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human vision is funny, in that there are a lot of things that never get noticed. Unless someone has a problem doing it, they never really notice your eyes focusing, for example. The truth is that they're focusing all the time. Another thing they never notice: when focused on one thing, everything else is blurry. This is partly because your eyes have the highest concentration of cells at the center, and also because of depth of field (DoF for short). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DoF is a natural effect of lenses. If a certain plain is focused, then everything around (in front of and behind) it is blurry. The focal length of the lens has a lot to do with how blurry. That is, the shorter the focal length, the less blur there is, and the more depth of field there is, regardless of aperture. </description>

          <title>I rolled over again...</title>
          <description>I've been lazy, but hey, everybody deserves a break now and then. Had another crash yesterday, broke my helmet but my head survived. Just a little road rash. Mostly I have pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0001.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KW's costume wins, on several levels. Scariest, most likely to give small children nightmares, best use of crutches, the list goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0002.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't take this one, sorry to dissappoint. It is pretty cool though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog11408/0003.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;Photos&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat Girl, sorry I forgot your name.

          <title>my method</title>
          <description>Several people have asked me recently &quot;how do you get pictures like that?&quot; or &quot;What lens do you use?&quot; or the like. I usually answer in my most serious voice: &quot;Magic.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, I have a certain technique that I use that I've developed over the years (almost ten years doing photography, now). I've spent a lot of time studying light. I've read every book of technique I could get my hands on. But the true technique is not found in a book; it is what happens when everything action is completely unpremeditated; there is no camera, there is no lens, no thoughts of exposure or aperture; there is only the picture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, to achieve this Zen state, there's a lot of practice and fumbling and mistakes. The best photographers are humble, generous sorts, because everyone has, at least once, dropped some piece of equipment worth more than their car. I'm kind of a klutz. I dropped a lens last saturday (and no, that won't date this little essay, because I do stupid shit often and still make good pictures). It is always looking through the viewfinder. I forget everything else in the whole world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there is a matter of a lot of practice. I used to shoot with an all manual leica, and it was the simplest most perfect camera ever. If I could just stick a sensor behind that thing that would spit out raw files, I would be obscenely happy. Leica, unfortunately f'ed up their digital camera so bad I found it almost unusable. I really have to be digital for two reasons: Time and money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that out of the way, there are some technical things that I do differently, at least somewhat. I always shoot with a fairly large aperture and high ISO. I own three different 50mm f/1.2 lenses, for different cameras (I have owned in the past a total of nine or ten lenses in 50mm focal length, not counting zooms or lenses in the similar 40mm length). I used to always meter with an incident light meter, set a manual exposure, and roll through a scene; now I use aperture priority because my camera has a meter inside. It works most of the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use manual focus a lot; enough that I have a dedicated manual lens. with af there is a tendency to not move the camera around; the focus points are where some designgeneer put them, and not where you want them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't say much more that I do, really; I play around a lot with composition and angle. Find interesting things to photograph. People are the most interesting to me. All of them. that's all.</description>

          <title>photos from strange days...</title>
          <description>I've felt really weird over the last week. I bonked my head, quit my job (for good this time), had totally wild nights and good days, and I feel wonderful for all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quitting my job was probably the best thing I've done since I started the job. If you're not doing what you want to be doing with your life, fucking stop that shit. Do better things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was this bonfire, lots of people, fire:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-1.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-2.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-3.jpg&quot;  /&gt;And yes, I know this is a cliche. Oh well. Reagan and Lauren:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-4.jpg&quot;  /&gt;Erin hit a nail right before getting to sauced friday:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-5.jpg&quot;  /&gt;Curt (sorry if that's the wrong spelling), and I have no idea where he got that hat:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-6.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-7.jpg&quot;  /&gt;Ash, new in town:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-8.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-9.jpg&quot;  /&gt;And then with the wig and glasses, the random costumery this guy finds, I don't know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-10.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was the cupping on saturday, a coffee tasting. It was interesting, although I have to say that whenever I'm on the sport to come up with words for taste, I draw a blank. It was cool though. Part of the random goodness of the week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-11.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-12.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog1020-13.jpg&quot;  /&gt;</description>

          <title>My weekend</title>
          <description>Finally over. I'm sort of still waiting for the other shoe to drop, as it were, but the disaster might be over (as I write that, I knock the wood of my desk firmly). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started well enough- got off work, came home, and apparently picked up my friend Traci to go into town for booze cruise. I say apparently because I can't remember. This is reconstructed memory and could be wrong. We get to Regan's house and start biking from there to get Vietnamese food. While on the way or the return, I'm not sure which, I was riding no-handed, and because of the damage I did to my bike last weekend with my car rack, it was a little more unstable than I'm used to and the front wheel did something funny and I went down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I landed on my right side. That wasn't a problem; my right side is as tough as my left, and my left is as tough as many. No, the problem is that no matter how tough you are, the concrete always wins against your skull. For illustration, see the photo in my previous post. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my memory, there is a big blank between leaving El Reno on Friday and early Saturday morning. If we include vague memories and flashes, my memory goes to about 6 in the evening, and picks up again at 2am. Traci and Reagan told me that for about two hours after the wreck, I was babbling the same two minutes of conversation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;How did I get here? I fell? Has someone checked for a concussion?...&quot; and then a restart two minutes later, as everything that was happening to me failed to get into long term memory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Reagan and Traci, though. They've got to be saints or angels, taking care of me like that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got home around 6am- Traci drove my car to her house out in choctaw, and then I drove myself home from there. Can't blame her for driving the first leg, as I wasn't terribly lucid for most of the night. I checked my eyes one last time, not because I couldn't remember them being fine, but because I was paranoid about going to sleep and slipping into a coma. I was fine, went to sleep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's not the end of the story. I woke up sore but mostly all right. I figured I should go back out, show everyone that I was fine, etc. This was a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drove to sauced with my bike on the back of the car. Went in, got a slice, chatted a little bit, found out there was something going on at the conseratory, a club way north on western. I finished my slice, said to myself &quot;hell, why not?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'm riding up there on my bike. I see a place that looks open, says Bar on the sign, but I get closer and realize it says &quot;Make Up Bar&quot; and despite the lights being on (should have been my first clue, most bars here black out their windows) they were closed. So I'm leaving the parking lot, and there's a couple lights out, and I hadn't truned on my headlight yet, and out of nowhere, this curb/island is in front of me, maybe two feet wide, and I hit it hard. I hit the pavement harder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I'm falling, I have time to think. I say to myself at least I'm wearing a helmet this time, but it's too bad there's nobody here to see. Just before I hit the concrete, I think, yeah, there's nobody to pick me up either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span &gt;Impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laid there for a minute, inventorying myself, realizing my neck hurt, but if it was broken, I was fucked anyway. I screamed a great gutteral curse, and sat up. The kind of word Tom Waits gargles in the morning after he brushes his teeth. With thorns. I stand up with no less effort, but a lot less whining, and go on to the club. What else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The club was dead. More than dead, it was goth night. I went in, found out there's no live acts, and gave up for good. Rode back to sauced, and on the way, I lost my hat. The hat was in my back pocket while I was wearing my helmet. Gone. So I made myself scarce too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sunday was solid. I slept in, woke up in pain, ans sat around for most of the day. Spent a few hours at coffee slingers drinking the best coffee in town, and that helped a lot. I'm still limping around a bit, but its cool. My neck is sore, it hurts to laugh still, but I'm alive.</description>

          <title>Okcity blog prop</title>
          <description>OKC needs a city blog. essays, photos, video, music, all things good about this city. There are amazingly good things here, a rich seam of characters and stories and projects and goodwill begging to be told. from a pitch I wrote to one of the people running the city sentinel:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What I am proposing is an Oklahoma City news blog, with breaking news stories, video, photo essays, and features built for the web. Oklahoma City is severely lacking good online content of the kind that draws lots of hits. I just looked at the Oklahoman online; what they're doing is trying to be a newspaper and a television station on a different pipe. It lacks focus on real day-to-day life. There's very little good multimedia, local stories, there is a flavor of reporting that often gets overlooked in a normal paper but that fits very well with the average internet user, because the constraints on the storytelling are very different on the internet. Local markets, community events, characters famous and infamous, there is a rich seam of stories begging to be told. Nobody is doing it here at all. There is a huge vacuum of good web content. Your organization is small and flexible, and I think could manage the translation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I mean by 'for the web': Text online can be both longer and shorter than in media; a little blurb can inform sometimes as well as a several column story. At the same time, it's possible to put out a 5000 word character portrait right next to that same little blurb. Videos with talking heads suck, everybody knows that, anything longer than about five minutes loses people online, so what is required is a quick, abrupt documentary veritÃ©. Don't dress it up, just tell the story. Be funny, be original, and genuine, that goes for everything. Photos are great alone, but do even better with audio, which gives context in place of a caption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about the internet, well, two great things about the internet: It is the most perfect and cheap printing press (copy machine) ever, and it reduces organization cost to zero. You have almost infinite space to do the story justice, and the more content you create, the more ad revenue you get; more stories mean more space; it's no good to bombard people with floating banners and flashing garish animations, but there are spots in a style where ads fit well and don't hurt the content. If the content is good, people will come, and come back, and spread the word themselves, and even send in news and photos.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see the news tonight, the world is falling apart. We need an antidote to that. A viable alternative.  I'm telling you all this because maybe you know people who might be interested in working on this with me? The onerous, terrible part: I'll have to sell ads. The amazing, wonderful part: the overhead is as close to zero as it could possibly be. We don't need an office, server space is cheap, all we have to do is keep maybe three or four people paid well enough. But they have to be three or four intensely creative passionate people. people who can keep up with long hours and no sleep and real insanity. You know anybody like that besides me?</description>

          <title>photos from friday night</title>
          <description>So, if anybody manages to find this, Hi. I took a lot of pictures tonight/this morning. If it looks like some people are here more, it's because lot of the ones from tonight were blurry (low light, bad focusing screen in my camera, etc), and I liked these best. Even a couple here blurry. In other words, it has nothing to do with what I think of you and everything with what I think of these pictures. (There were actually more people around than it might seem from these photos, and yes, I have pictures of them, but they're shitty. The pictures. The people are awesome). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oct4/0001.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oct4/0001.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karaoke=Madness+Awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oct4/0002.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/oct4/0002.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pile O' Bikes.

          <description>but having fun anyway. who needs money, right?

I'm amazed he's walking, but back on a bike, even for a few feet? His range of motion and flexibility are phenomenal. I'd still be in bed eating ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog928-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mike showed up too, which was nice.

She's supposed to email me and I'm then supposed to email her the pic. Sarah, if you happen to find this, feel free to steal it from here, too. (That goes for anyone who's image is here. If it's you, and you want to take the pic and do whatever with it, go ahead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I'm mostly broke now. If I pay my bills, that is. If not, I've got cash to last a little while.I should pay them and then look for work. That's what I'll do. Yeah.</description>

          <title>NOLA and stuff</title>
          <description>Been a long couple of days. Lot of things happening. Where to begin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Orleans is an amazing city, the kind of place just on the cusp of some really cool things happening. After disaster comes innovation and change, and it's such a wild place it's bound to come there. It might not have the population to count, but it's such a great combination of cool people and danger and culture and history that things are bound to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also great to see Jeana and Hope, the real reason I was down there. They act a lot like a married couple, in a funny co-dependent way. Good people, and I'm not just saying that because they read this. Hi Ladies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I drove by the lower 9th ward. It's a whole neighborhood, but subtract all the people and leave the houses to rot for 3 years, and that's what's left. It's shameful and angering, and we should do better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of time in airports. I'm weird in that I really like the airport, even with the bullshit you have to go through to get to the gate. The one thing I don't like is the cramped seats on some of the smaller planes. But airports are such weird inbetween borderlike places that I can't help but love them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then two days of work. Somehow we ended up talking about politics a lot today, and I have to say it was refreshing. When you talk to people, you actually have to think about why you have your ideas of how things should be and back them up. That and it also sharpens your wits, if you keep thinking after you're done talking, about why and the flaws in what the other person said and how to explain your POV better the next time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, pictures to follow.</description>

          <title>In the Airport</title>
          <description>so, I'm chillin in the airport, and waiting on a flight. By the way, fuck all the politicians. I'm on my way to the city that care forgot, otherwise known as New Orleans. I don't know what to expect. That's the best reason I know to go anywhere: it's impossible to get an idea of some places with out going there. The truth of the situation can only be grasped from ground level. Too many stories over too much time, too much mental clutter. I hate to say it but average reporting is a pale gray thing next to the vital lived experience of a place.we'll see. More as it happens.</description>

These two together (or separately) are just really awesome, good company and good friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0003.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0003.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clines Corners tourist trap, where I had an early lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0004.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0004.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I'm still doggedly taking my camera to the supermarket. Yes, there are still more pictures to be had there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0005.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0005.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is my current project: updating my portfolio. Hopefully by the end of the week I'll have shopped it around and have real work as a photojournalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0006.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog9-2-08-0006.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

          <title>Things that make me happy...</title>
          <description>Yesterday I had the most exciting time mowing the grass. You know, normally I hate it, it's boring drudgery in the hot sun, but I got home about half an hour before storms were coming in. So I decided to race the storms to get the front yard mowed. there was distant lightening and darkening skies and me, running to try and get done. I made it, just as the first drops came down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was all tired after that, and I wasn't going to go out, but then KW texted me (I have a feeling he bulk texted a bunch of people). But anyway, knowing people were out was enough to get me out. Beers and interesting times and new friends. I got home and I was totally exhausted, so I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slept 11 hours. I was asleep for 11 hours. All at one time. I never sleep that long. I'm so used to four or five hours and exhaustion, I've go it down to an art. I feel so much better today. It's awesome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be photos eventually. As soon as I get off my lazy ass and download the card that's been in the camera since I came back from santa fe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now: welding, car repair and fun times.</description>

          <title>hey, I remembered that name</title>
          <description>and other stuff, too. Arianna, and I have no idea why I got such a block about it. Actually, it could have to do with the emotional stress of the week and the madness therein. What else? I've been thinking about things to say on here and lots will occur when I'm out and about, but not a lot comes to me now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to Egypt and Gaza in January. Actually, I'm only definitely going to Egypt, getting into Gaza is a matter of getting to know the right people once I'm on the ground, fining the right border guard to bribe, or a small row boat to row a few miles trough the blockade. Or any combination of the three above things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of my backups are stale by a week now. If you don't know, this is a terrible thing. Although it's better than none at all, I need to run a full backup tonight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought new headphones today, both ears work, so that's good. Not much else to report. Money's low. more later if I get inspired of crazy or something.</description>

          <title>santa fe dreams</title>
          <description>Still here. Had a really excellent dinner with Mike and Tina and their lovely daughter who's name I'm drawing a complete blank on. It'll come back to me. Really good food though, I've never had a bad meal there, and the company is extraordinary. It's always a treat. Then, I had a nice talk with (insert youngest daughter's name here, which I now have a major mental block around, even though we've known each other for a few years now) after Mike and Tina went to bed. It's really rare to find someone who I can really talk to, who has interesting things to say, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-1.jpg&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in other news, I got kicked out of Alex's place the other night. Well, first I did a semi-pornographic shoot with Kit, which the roommates didn't like. I can't fathom what a bunch of hetero bachelors would find objectionable about a naked woman in the house, but that's just me. The shoot itself went really well, Kit is happy with the pictures, and you should be able to see them eventually on suicidegirls.com. Yeah, that classy porn site. If such an oxymoron is beyond your ken, sorry. (As an aside, this is the only way I'll do certain kinds of photography: nudes, weddings, and a few others, you have to be my friend first, and ask nicely. I'm likely to do it for free, though). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Blog821-2.jpg&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else? Mad drama which is now solved and not worth talking about; staying in andrew's house; and the internet in the hospital is down, so I'm posting tethered to my phone. We blinged alex's walker. Chilled on the plaza. Lots of drinking in small portions, a beer here, a glass of wine there. I haven't been really drunk for several days, though. Now, Photos!</description>

          <title>in santa fe again...</title>
          <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0001.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0001.jpg&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it looks like I'll be here until Sunday next, chilling and helping out where I can.  Alex is doing really well, considering the extent of his injury; broken pelvis and a cracked rib to boot would lay anybody up for a few days. Kit on the other hand, is just phenomenal. First of all, she seems about ten times hotter than when I last saw her, is taking care of Alex's every need, setting up a place for him to live and a way to get there and dealing with all the details of wrapping up his Santa Fe life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0002.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0002.jpg&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0003.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0003.jpg&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm doing little things, like driving, and craigs-listing the truck, but mostly I think I'm here to help everyone keep their shit together and lose it under the stress. I don't know how many times I've told Kit to breathe and &quot;It'll be ok, we'll get it sorted,&quot; etc. And then there are the secret missions that i can't really talk about because they're secret and Alex reads this sometimes. You'll enjoy it Al, I swear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0004.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/Alex_hip/0004.jpg&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's about it here so far.

          <title>going away a little</title>
          <description>So I'm headed home today, and I get a call from Kit, and Alex is in the hospital. Broken pelvis. So I'm going to Santa Fe. Tomorrow I'll go out and see what I can do to help them, Alex and Kit, because they're some of my closest friends and really I'd be a terrible person if I didn't go do what I can. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for all of you OKC people, that's where I'll be for the next couple days/possibly a week or two. Catch you all when I get back. there might/should be updates here as things go; I'll have plenty of time for blogging.</description>

          <title>js in blogger</title>
          <description>so anyway, if you want to do any javascript in blogger, you've gotta put in in your template, in the header, to make it work. as far as I can figure. could be I needed ADATA tags, but anyway, there's source now to embed a javascript gallery into blogger in the post below and the header of the blog. This is for people that have their own server space. All the functions are in the header, and the stuff in the post is function calls and definitions, how many photos and where to get them. File names go in the array, and if you name your photos 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg, etc, then you won't have to even change that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an awesome weekend though. Crazy coincidences, party, artshow/b-boys. 950 pictures saturday night/sunday morning. I danced! I talked to pretty girls, ran towards a fight, slept on a couch, and had brunch in style on sunday. shitty javascript too, fixed monday in 15 minutes of fresh coding on lunch. also some shitty food sometime before sunday evening made me miss soccer, not the brunch though, that was too soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the photos below are real keepers, as in they're going in my portfolio. Into the edit I'm doing now at least. I decided that I need the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adorama.com/INKD700.html&quot;&gt;D700&lt;/a&gt; beacuse let's face it, I would have a lot less blurries at ISO 25000. and the focusing screen! so much better. It won't make me a better photographer, but it's one hell of a lot sharper knife to cut with, if you can dig it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Video of the sequence of b-boys coming whenever I get my shit together, maybe tomorrow. If it were my job I would have done it sunday. But my job is boring, dull, and unimaginative. Fuck it, I'm going to go do that now. Video before I sleep if it kills me tomorrow.</description>

          <title>Matt Mills makes with the manic</title>
          <description>so, I'm bored. Not just a little bored, but epically madly stuck in a rut bored. Normally what I do when this happens is, well, something crazy, I take a trip or cut off my hair or have some brilliant idea and go off after it for a while. All of my options right now fall into two categories: the &quot;I don't want to&quot; and the &quot;I really shouldn't.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I should do is edit the 7000 pictures I've shot since coming back here into some kind of portfolio. That's what I call a good start.</description>

          <title>out with the old</title>
          <description>So sunday I finally gave up my old car for an even older car. My Mercury Sable has been with me for about three years, four or five girlfriends (I can never keep count) 60,000 miles, and a lot of good and bad times. Some of the bad times were when I had to piece it back together after it failed me, but that's only happened a few times; it's been remarkably reliable in the clutch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this post goes out to all the miles and all the memories. </description>

          <title>must... post...</title>
          <description>So anyway, I'm still alive. I've been uber responsible about sleeping and working and whatnot, and you know what it's gotten me? I'm about to go stir crazy. I stare at the empty soulless nature of my existence and wonder why the fuck I'm doing what I'm doing. I can do better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So tonight, I changed all that. I drove home from Mcalester, which is about two hours, and ate dinner and then rode out to sauced on the bike. (Yes, this is Oklahoma, there's only one bike and we all take turns). I knew I would be out too late to get any rest. I knew I should have probably finished processing the section I had finished shooting earlier. Screw working off the clock for no reason and screw rest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went, and I sat and drank a couple of beers that I didn't really have money for, called Alex, said happy late birthday to him (note to self: 22nd), and then people showed up, Haley and Erin and other dude, I should know his name, I know him but I cant remember his name. So we go for a ride, downtown, then we go back to sauced, chill only for a brief moment, then ride with erin home. Then the lightning started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I booked it home in like 30 minutes, which is super fast for that trip for me. There 's this one long dark stretch of deserted road that 's either really awesome or really shitty, because it's dark and kind of lonely, but mostly that's a good thing for me right before I go home to all the comforts therein. Good for thinking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I thought tonight is that when I make good, responsible, sensible decisions about what to do with myself, I'm unhappy, and when I do what I want to, I'm much happier. The punchline: My time is my time. There was more to this all, but I don't want to talk about the shitty day I had or why I was pissed. Stupid creditors.</description>

          <title>1000 words</title>
          <description>Everything you need to know about shooting pictures in 1000 words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, we're talking from a purely technical standpoint. What does what and a little of why. This is the iambic pentameter to sonnets we all hope our photographs will be. A photograph is an image formed by the action of photons on a sensitive medium. The light is usually focused by a lens, or concentrated by a pinhole, to form a coherent image of the world in front of the camera. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three things you have control over are focus, exposure, and where to point the camera. We are only dealing with the first two, thank the gods. The third is enough to talk about for centuries. Focus and exposure are controlled by four interrelated settings or choices: ISO (sensitivity of your medium), Shutter speed, aperture, and focus distance. In the old days, you chose an ISO and film like you chose a religion, but now there's a lot of room for play because everything can be changed on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;ds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About exposure: Too much light makes the picture all white. Too little light and the picture goes black. There is an amount of light that is just right for the scene you're trying to take a picture of, and this is called the correct exposure. The light and dark of a picture can be largely creative, but a new photographer should get a feel for correct exposure before doing anything crazy. Most any camera these days has a pretty good meter built in, but the right exposure isn't always what your meter tells you. Sometimes it's brighter, sometimes it's darker. Meters try to get a scene to hit in the middle of their tonal range. A scene with a lot of white, or bright things in it, will come out too dark. A scene with a lot of dark shadows or blacks will come out too light. Middle gray is boring. We need more than that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the three factors that you can use to affect exposure. They are all measured in f-stops, which is a logarithmic scale which halves or doubles the light for each step. If you go up one stop on the shutter speed and down one stop on the aperture, the amount of light stays the same. Some people will quibble over halfs and thirds of stops, these people are the enemy and should not be invited for dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scale (in full stop increments) of shutter speeds is 1/8000, 1/4000, 1/2000, 1/1000, 1/500, 1/250, 1/125, 1/60, 1/30, 1/15, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, etc. Those are fractions of a second. That's how much time you have. The 1/ is left off on most cameras for brevity and simplicity. Speeds of less than 1/30 are likely to result in blurry pictures because of camera shake. The more time you give to the exposure, the more light gets in. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>Rule #1: Always have your camera</title>
          <description>So, instead of boring you with stupid vapid details of my life that nobody cares about but me, and that I in all likelihood won't care about tomorrow, I'm going to write about photography. Methods, rules and techniques. These are old school &quot;learn to use then learn to break&quot; rules. My 1000 word photo one lesson will be in here. The stuff I was thinking about for&lt;span &gt; Methods of Photography&lt;/span&gt; will be here. Meanderings, maybe. How I work, definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, rule 1: Always carry your camera. Other people should think you have codependency issues with that machine. It doesn't matter if your chosen instrument weighs one ounce or five pounds, it should always be with you. Other people will think you're crazy, and that's fine. Other people don't have to be on the que vive to do their work. They can note an idea and follow up on monday. We photographers are forever here and now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry 15 lbs of camera and lenses and batteries everywhere. I carry it so much I got home from the store yesterday, went out back to grill hot dogs, and I didn't even realize I still had the bag on until I tried to sit down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of bags, the bag you carry your shit in is also important, if you use one. It's gotta be bombproof, bulletproof, waterproof, and just a little bigger than you think. Quick access. Padding or no is up to you. I use unpadded bags because I hate the added bulk of padding and most of them are in either unfashionable or unfunctional shapes. There is more variety of good unpadded bags. Right now I use a crumpler. In the past, it's been a domke, but I saw the crumpler in REI and had to have it. It's only the third bag I've ever had that I really liked. I carry one body plus two lenses, sometimes three. No flash. Spare batteries. Pick the things you think you need, carry them around for a little while, get rid of them if you decide you don't use them enough to be worth the weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because sometimes, you just need your camera, and you'll never know when that's going to be. You're going to be tired, barely able to move, eyes closing involuntarily, and there, in front of you, will be the perfect pictures unfolding. What good is seeing as a photographer sees (in pictures, of course) if you haven't a camera to put it to use?</description>

          <description>I've experienced the situation that word describes so many times it's excruciating. Not this weekend though. No future exes found, just a lot of Santa Fe love. It's a mad cool town. I'm stuck in a rut, and then I go there and I start to do stuff again. Looking for a model to play around in front of a white backdrop. We'll see. Pictures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alex on a trike.

Even if he wasn't he sure could play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-6.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And this little kid was too awesome . me and Alex decided he was a combination of the two of us- loves to take stuff apart (me) and totally narcissistic (Al), loving attention. He's a monster and he's going to take over the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog714-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Finally, here's Alex's fingers. From the bus hitting him, his right pinky is not right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I just cut a picture of a sunset arbitrarily, and I'm declaring no more sun/cloud pictures for a while. Shit gets old, even if they are pretty.</description>

          <title>Santa fe, the coda</title>
          <description>so I went back to santa fe last weekend, saw some folks, did some santa fe things. I didn't go to whole foods. I did go into the mountains a couple times. Hit up the cowgirl, the tin star, and the catamount in a single night. stayed with alex, saw some other heads, missed Nicole somehow, I think she was herself just getting back from cali. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not that okc is bad, it's that other places are so much better. Pictures to follow.</description>

          <title>on selling out</title>
          <description>I set aside my beliefs for money. I work for people that take oil and gas out of the ground and sell it. Never mind that it's a lot of money. Never mind that extractive industries are not bad, that the particular people I work for are separated by degrees from anything I can call wrong, that the companies that are their clients are good, performing a needed service. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's examine what belief I'm setting aside here. Is it my deeply held belief that capitalism is evil, that corporations by their nature do bad things? I don't believe either of those things without reserve, though. Unregulated capitalism is completely unsustainable and self destructs. The last time this happened, we called it the great depression. But with good regulation, Capitalism isn't a bad system, so long as basic human needs (food, shelter, water, medicine) aren't subject to market economies. They are in a lot of places, and this seems to lead to tragedy (see for example, water strikes in south America, recent food crises worldwide, the healthcare system here in the states). So no, capitalism isn't essentially evil, but the uses it's put to make it do bad things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corporations, though, are pretty bad. They make lots of money, which is the problem. You can't get money without someone else losing money, resources, time, or all of the above. In general, the little guy gets screwed. In my work though, luckily for all te rights holders, there are laws binding whoever drills and extracts to pay what they owe, to clean up after themselves, and generally good corporate citizens. At least here, in the little area I'm working in, they don't really do anything bad. They perform a service, pay for what they take, and the common good is served. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil though, there's a big topic. I don't think we should go to war over oil. I think our burn rate (of energy total) is outrageous, that we should be able to make do with a quarter (or less) of what we use. I'm not an engineer, though. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcecameraproject.org&quot;&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; things sometimes, but I'm not going to come up with the replacement for fossil fuels. It &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.focusfusion.org&quot;&gt;will&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polywell&quot;&gt;happen&lt;/a&gt; though. So again, it's a wash. With or without me, the days of burning hydrocarbons for energy are numbered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if what I'm doing doesn't conflict with any of my beliefs, makes me money to let me do what I want to do, is that still selling out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(edit: fixed the broken link to focus fusion society)</description>

          <title>It's the mustache that makes it Awesome</title>
          <description>So I'm at my uncle's house in texas right now, and we were all sitting outside and I was shooting some long exposures of people, and pat says something to the effect of &quot;Doesn't matter how fancy your camera is, you need some light.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I keep shooting. I get this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog705-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog705-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously not the camera. It's the fake mustache on the front.

          <title>thumb</title>
          <description>first of all, my thumb is fine. I lost a chunk of skin, that's all. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/arts/design/24isla.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;This is hilarious.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/galleries/split_second/&quot;&gt;Barbra Probst&lt;/a&gt; on her photos of the same subject, same instant, from many perspectives. Her comment about not caring about what's in the pictures so much as how they're taken is bullshit, and a good example of why you don't have to listen to what the artist says all the time. It's a cool idea, though, and the photos are really interesting, so go look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for my photography, I've finally realized what I need to do. I'm at a bit of a creative dead end, not knowing what to do for a while. So, I'm gonna bust with the white seamless (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richardavedon.com/#s=0&amp;a=0&amp;mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;p=7&amp;at=0&quot;&gt;Richard Avedon&lt;/a&gt;) to get the juices flowing again. I even have a model in mind, if she's free next weekend. now, to the shower.</description>

          <description>Rule #13: Never place your hand or fingers or any part of your body between any metal fittings or components. Use a tool instead. Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0701-1.jpg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see why. (Warning: Kinda Gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, after dressing the wound, after putting in the new part, the car is still jumping into 1st gear. When it fails completely, I'm getting new wheels.</description>

          <title>lostish</title>
          <description>Feelin' kinda lost tonight, folks. Outside, far away from where I want to be. Half the world, in fact. I dream of running under the desert sun, under fire, not knowing what will happen next or if I will be alive to see it. It's the very edge of everything, chaos, terror, horror, and I really want to go and see it for myself. To take pictures and send them back to people in their calm normal existences, and maybe someone will wake up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crazy thing is, I can do that. Six months, I'll have the money to go anywhere in the world long enough to make contacts and pictures and sell them and really start a career. It's wild and it's crazy and I'm going to do it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weird thing, why I'm lost: I'm not where I want to be, but I don't mind where I am. I have a good job, good money, lots of friends. The climate here sucks, and the scenery  is mostly the clouds, but it isn't a bad place. I could hang around here and make a decent life, find some little thing with enough curves and brain cells to keep us entertained, make this job into a career with some law school, and have a good, happy time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could do that, a nice stable life. Fuck that though. Why be normal when I can live a dream? Why do average when I can do whatever I want? Hotter women, more languages, more danger, more life. Feel every breath, see every person, love them all. Keep shooting and keep shooting until my light goes out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, not lost any more. Time to sleep.</description>

          <title>hi, boss.</title>
          <description>And hi all the other people. Here's the deal: you can look at the pictures, ignore the writing, and probably get 75% of the good stuff I've put up here. (Theres this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/blog/2008/04/destructive-dissassembly.html&quot;&gt;one thing&lt;/a&gt; I'm proud of, nothing else comes to mind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, my boss found this site, and called me a serious blogger, and made some joke about terrorism. I don't don't know what that's supposed to mean... I don't think I've ever written about my politics here, and I don't think blowing shit up helps anybody, no matter who's doing it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really though, there are some serious bloggers out there, but I'm not one. I'm a dilletante, too busy to go hunting links or shit. I just throw up my photos for people to see, tell some stories now and again, lather, rinse, repeat. I don't spell check or proofread, except the casual glances I give my html to see if it'll work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was an exceptionally good day though. I went and got some coffee from coffee slingers, which is this trendy place downtown, but they are really good at the whole coffee thing. I had one 12 oz cup and I felt amazing all day. Really good. I felt like a human being, with all the social graces and instincts and quick wit that I sometimes can muster, all from a little paper cup. Like whoa. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got up a little late, thinking I had a shorter drive, but I ended up having to go all the way to (censored). 2 hours. I then shot 3 whole pictures, emailed them to the person chaining the title, and waited a little bit because he said he might need something else. He didn't call, so on I went to (censored), an hour and a half away. Shot for the whole afternoon, didn't do too bad, 500 photos. My half-day record is 1000, whole day is 1800, and I had to get a wrist brace for my right because those days were right together and it's still a little sore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That coffee was really something though. High-test, I'm calling it in my head, like they used to call high octane gas. Better stuff. Makes everything run smoother, more powerful. We'll see tomorrow if it was a fluke or what.</description>

          <title>I found some more photos...</title>
          <description>from the alleycat, actually broken &quot;src&quot; tags. Fixed now, so take a look below. Work goes, and goes, and goes. Still more driving than a nail gun in a roofing project. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm reading three books right now, &quot;bomb the suburbs&quot; about hip-hop culture, &quot;Camera lucida&quot; about photography, and &quot;The Yiddish Policemen's union,&quot; an alternate history novel. Bomb the Suburbs has some flaws, starting with the title. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, Bomb the suburbs. As social theories go, race analysis sucks. You can't generalize along race lines. Economic and class analysis, however, can be really really good at finding whys and solutions. Second: cultures always cross pollinate and steal things from each other and everybody is richer for it. Wismatt, the author, is against the mainstreaming and what he sees as cheapening of hip-hop, because (to paraphrase) what it was was real, and what it's become is whack and stupid and missing the point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a thought: the mainstreaming of hip hop has created a cultural dialogue that didn't exist before, has given legitimacy to several new ways of making art, and has empowered people on both sides of the perceived divide to communicate in ways that weren't possible before. And the great thing about dialogue, about discourse: there's always more to say, and rappers and b-boys and kids from the burbs are still out there talking. Of course there's going to be stupid shit out there you can ridicule and try to use to say that the world is fucked up and nobody gets it any more, but you gotta have the shit so you know what smells good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camera Lucida is a lot more thoughtful. If &quot;On Photography&quot; (sontag's shitty rant) was about photo with a small p, Camera Lucida is about photography with a capital P. By prodding gently at the subject, rather than slashing and burning, some really interesting ideas come through. Then again, I'm only one chapter in, so it might start to suck soon. Philosophy books usually lose me pretty quickly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep now. Later everybody.</description>

          <title>I suppose I should post, </title>
          <description>I just don't feel like writing. Weird. During the day, I have ideas, but not really time to write them, so they don't get done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything keeps changing, again and again. It's so fast, it's hard to keep up, but at the same time, it all just flows and i roll with it. Some of the chaos is my creation, some of it is shit that happens, and some a combination.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

          <title>50 Posts! Awesome!</title>
          <description>wow. I never knew. I figured this blog wouldn't make it to ten posts, much less fifty. And people are reading. Hi people. Here's photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0608-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0608-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is from last sunday when I should have been in bed.

On the concrete. It was more than a little hard to take this one, as I had to lean out over the edge of the bridge, and see what would happen if I fell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0609-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0609-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Driving to work.

One place that commonly comes up is the supermarket. I'm out to prove them wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0614-8.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0614-8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now off into tthe wild blue yonder.

          <title>weird search</title>
          <description>so people are still coming here searching for &quot;Matt Mills porn&quot;. You kids are weird. First of all, I don't even have a girlfriend. Second of all, I don't do porn. Artful nudes, maybe, and a friend of mine once asked me to do suicide girl shoot for her, but that never went through and so I really have nothing remotely like porn for you people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, work work work. Went to see Adam yesterday, he seems all right. Broke up as all hell, but all things that'll heal eventually. I'm not a doctor, nor a psychologist,  but I have a feeling he's gonna make a good recovery. Tons of good people around him (I mean all the folks I've met over the last few weeks, the Hellcats and boneshakers and just the community around bikes, really lots of awesome people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also discovered I don't know how to stick weld at all. I was over at KW's house, he has a workshop and a welding machine. So I decided to build a frankenbike, and then I couldn't put two pieces of metal together to save my life. Although I told my dad what was going on (he's a weldor) and he said it was a case of everything in the situation being wrong, not just that I didn't know any technique. Rod was oxidized and probably too large, so useless. I'll try again next week maybe. Dad said he'd show me some things too, so that'll be cool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I gotta go sleep. Catch you later, internets.</description>

          <title>Forgetting names</title>
          <description>So I'm meeting a bunch of new people, hanging out with more or less the same group for a few weeks, and at times I really feel shitty, because I can't for the life of me remember their names. Actually, it got a lot better tonight (I don't care that the post time says ten something, it's really 3am), there were introductions for someone else new, and I think I'll remember several more now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam, who is pictured &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with his wife, had a really bad wreck. Nobody knows for sure what happened, except some woman saw him come over the side of a bridge over I-44 and stopped to call 911. Multiple injuries, face, knee, ankles, femur, bike's a wreck. I find it hard to believe that all that happened from a fall, but then again, a fall onto concrete from 40 feet (about the height of the bridge) could maybe cause a broken femur. I still think maybe a car was involved. There is maybe a video of the incident, so maybe we can see what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a thought though, about a story I might do. Bike wrecks caused by cars. Close calls. Talk about how scary it is to be out there on the road with a bunch of homicidal maniacs in death machines aimed at you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To tell the truth, I almost didn't ride tonight, I thought about driving. at the last second, i realized it was stupid, that not riding was the worst thing I could do, and so I pedaled up to sauced. And that hand-built wheel I finally put back on the bike? Amazing. Anyway, that's all. I really should offload my card and post pictures, but I'm lazy and tired and I'll do it tomorrow sometime, I swear.</description>

          <title>work, work, work...</title>
          <description>All week long, so not much to talk about. Although everyone's been asking me wether or not I like my job at work which leads me to believe that someone there has been reading the blog... well, the answer is, I really do like my job. OK? I really like the paycheck, and I know that long term (I'm thinking in years here) it's not what I'm going to end up doing. I get to meet lots of people, push myself in interesting ways. Organization, never my strong suit, is critical, and so I'm learning how to do it. I get to meet interesting people, and one of my strong suits, being endearing to the surly, is a big help some places. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My existential doubts the other day (and what I wrote here) were really me thinking out loud. Sometimes I write because I have a good idea, a story to tell. Sometimes I have an idea to work out and if I write it down I can see it better. Then there's what I did the other day: putting my doubts and fears down so I can see if they're real or not after a little time has passed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a little time has passed and I've been working and getting a better feel for what is going on, and it's a good thing, for the most part. The problems I have with corporations, big oil, etc. are political problems. This work isn't political in the least. It's just a low level function of a market economy. A demand for information is being filled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I need a nap. Photos to follow later, before booze cruise.</description>

          <title>coffee and cigarettes</title>
          <description>...are what the gods gave us to make up for all the shit they put on us. Sometimes, it's enough to make up for it. Sometimes, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women. What the hell? I thought I'd found someone, and now she's gone off with another guy. (I'm struck now by the recurring themes in my love life, but I digress). How often have I met a woman that I thought was really worthwhile? I'm not talking meet someone who just happens to be smart or sexy and I'm attracted to, but more like love at first sight. You catch a glimpse of her and it's a physical feeling, taking a blow to the head, to the chest, whatever, and you know already that she'll be amazing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's happened to me three times. I don't know why three, not one or none, I don't know why I'm not still with any of these three wonderful gorgeous smart girls, I don't know a lot of things. My life has been, so far, very much a series of strange and wonderful events that I don't have any hope of understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll tell the first story, and because she's still around, in the OKC area somewhere, I've gotta come up with an alias. Call her Annie. So, I was in the sixth grade. Walking down a hall at an academic team tourney (jeopardy for schoolkids). we both looked up at the same time, right into each other's eyes, and said &quot;I know you...&quot; Which, of course, we didn't. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talked for a second, and then I didn't see her again until maybe 6 months later. Maybe it was less, maybe it was more.  And I was so inept then that she actually got my phone number first, on some lame excuse. OK, I lied when I used past tense just then. I still suck at details like getting names and numbers. Anyway, we went out for a little less than a year. By then, I was in the eighth grade, and I was talking with my dad, who always has good advice that I don't want to hear, and I could see my whole life stretching out before me. A nice, normal life, go to a state school for free, get a nice job somewhere safe, have my girl with me through the whole thing, yada yada. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's exactly what I thought. How boring. Lame. Go do something fun and exciting with your life. You've gotta burn it up, gotta be more than a cog in a hierarchy of other cogs. Get out of that now, while you can. So, to separate myself from all of that, to cut it off, I did the most destructive thing I could think of: I broke up with the girl I loved. I still don't sleep right. </description>

          <title>Photos from most of the weekend</title>
          <description>OK, so before I run off and do more crazy shit, the photos and some more story need to go here. So before I was having all those metaphysical doubts, I got home Friday and then turned around and went out to the Rooster to see who would be around and generally  drink. before that though, I ran by best buy and picked up my new ipod, 16gb touch. I actually like it quite a lot, the battery lasts a lot longer than my n800 and the volume goes up louder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0529-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0529-1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got there to the booze cruise, and it turned out to be mostly booze, which was nice after a fairly long week. Then my bank card came back declined, despite the paycheck I'd put in earlier that day. It was all good, though, between pitchers and people willing to cover me for the cover at the Blue Note. The band they had as sort of all right as long as you didn't pay them any attention, which was hard as loud as they were. By the time we got there the place was more or less empty except for the bar itself. Magically, beers kept appearing in front of me. I was fairly drunk by the end of the night. I rode home probably faster still than any other time, maybe 20 minutes for 8 miles. No stops. It was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0530-3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I woke up Saturday to go to this bike happening in Mesta Park. I stopped on the way to get a new rear tire, the old one was worn through. Saw Mike, who works at the shop and is an all-around nice guy, said hello, had a coffee next door at coffee slingers, which is really good coffee, by the way, and free wifi to boot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the park, where there were sprints, a slow race, and all sorts of fun things. That wast most of my day, fixie tricks and hanging out and soaking up the sun. I Helped these two girls with their bikes, little things, seat adjustment and brake tension, but it's little things like that which make a ride fun or a pain in the ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next stop was this water park on 36th and Classen, public and free, just out there for people to come and cool off. All kinds of ways to get watered. That was one of the more fun parts of the day, and I have no pictures from it. Oh well. Then the whole group went en masse to the infoshop, which is where I started to feel conflicted about my job a little. Oh well, fuck that. Know the world glued your back to the wall, gotta brawl through that, like Jay z said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were having a barbeque, vegetarian, of course, and I had my first ever veggie burger. Tasteless, bland, and later my stomach was not happy with me. The vibe I was getting from them was weird: sort of slightly superior defensive insular. I left to get smokes, came back, and some people were hanging out inside, and the feeling was different: we were telling jokes and riddles and just hanging out. So I don't know about that whole situation/group/whatever. Of course, they're all individuals and probably cool taken by themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-6.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after that I was pretty exhausted, so I came home and went to bed. I know, boring. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing else to report, except I'm editing a new portfolio to go up here soon. We'll see how good it looks, I like the pictures at least. Speaking of pictures: here's one last for your visual enjoyment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0531-7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

          <title>I think I've used all possible iterations of "rock" in a title already</title>
          <description>So, anyway, It's been a good couple of days. Drove to Durant and back Thursday and Friday. Three hours one way. But then Friday I got my first paycheck, which was totally awesome. Three months with no money really wears on a guy, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The driving. God there's a lot of driving. Long stretches of road, hot, way way too hot with my broken air conditioner. My watch thermometer said 110 at one point when I was stuck in traffic on Friday. Is it any wonder people get road rage and hate to drive? I still enjoy it in the morning though. Get up, pack my work-things, go to it. Drinking coffee on the highway, I listen to music and think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I think is, I'm a vulture. I go around getting photos of all this title research so somebody can buy property, whether it's oil and mineral rights or the surface or whatever. They have to find it though, and get exact legal standings of every little piece. So that's where I come in and photo all the title documents, send them to someone who knows how to decipher what they mean and send that information onto someone else, who then buys or leases rights, and maybe they're extracting something and maybe not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'm a little conflicted. I was hanging out with these hippie anarchists (their pamphlets and zines were indicative of this if not the blond dreadlocks many of them sported), and it got me to thinking: What is this concept of big oil, and who decided it was necessarily evil? And am I complicit in working for these people, even at the bottom of a very large hierarchy? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what I think: My job would get done anyway. Market forces right now are making oil so valuable that any hole with the least drop of it at the bottom is valuable. I'm not at the top making decisions, and I can't have any effect on the bad things that happen in other countries because of oil. Here in the US at least, there are good laws on the books (and contractual obligations to the surface-rights holders) to maintain the land on the surface. I'm a contract worker for a company that itself has contracts with the people actually digging. I could take any shit job and maybe cover my expenses, but with this job I can cover my expenses, keep my sanity, and be done with my debt much sooner. So it's ok. I think. OK, readers, all five of you: am I selling out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to go mow grass. More about the rocking weekend later.</description>

          <title>Playing to the obvious</title>
          <description>I like beer. I like women, I like sunlight on my face. I like the cold of the morning, the warmth of laying next to someone. I like wandering, meeting new people, the light of streetlights, the light when there isn't any. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my bicycle, the wind in my face. I like sweating and feeling tired and the deep ache of exhaustion. I like sleep, I like to dream. I like taking pictures. I like my job, because I like money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the feeling of moving. I like getting on a plane. I like just driving for the sake of moving, without a destination. I like the music of the road, both from the stereo and the tires. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the curve of your hips, your deep brown eyes, your quick smile, the way I can read you so easily. I like the way you smell, even in the morning. I like your tattoos.  I miss you, Jess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's all, except to say that you could easily put love instead of like.</description>

          <description>Went back to Paseo arts fest yesterday, met up with some more new cool kids, lots of fixed gear riders. Glad to see some community here around cycles. A lot of the kids seem genuinely cool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- sorry the post yesterday was so incoherent. spillover from the crazy week.

          <title>rock and roll will never die</title>
          <description>because there's dudes out there keepin it real, reality being important as it's all we have. That's not true, we have imagination too, angels have wings because they take themselves lightly, so we must do the same if we hope to fly. I'm rambling drunk if you can't tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just took a nice ride over to Sauced, the bike and dog friendly hippyish pizza place just north of 23rd. Good pizza, ran into some kids, one who I think I knew from somewhere, but unfortunately he was an asshole and wouldn't talk to me. He happened to have photos, but they were terribly cliche, super white girl in black underwear with a gas mask, black and white, you know, art school special. but then this other dude turned out to be cool, rides fixed gear, works in a shop here, knows the scene pretty well. appearently there are a couple bike gangs. Who knew? Alleycat next week too. So that'll be fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's see. Had some work stuff which I'm not going to talk about, because unfortunately, my job has some confidentiality required. But it was handled quickly and efficiently once I went over to my bosses house, the man has connections, and I'll leave it at that. Lucky for all of us, and I have a feeling it would have been me taking shit for it if he hadn't worked it out. Then again, he got to know all the people he knows by being a really nice guy, so who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to going to the paseo arts fest tomorrow. I'll probably bike over. It's another day in paradise, and I get to sleep in. Peace.</description>

          <title>An intense couple of days</title>
          <description>good times though. I like my new job. Lots of driving. Lots of seeing different places.  I shot more pictures in a week than I did in the six months before. unfortunately, they're all terribly boring, but fortunately, it pays well. Or will. First payday isn't  until the first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0521-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0521-1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some tings I was going to say, but because of sleep deprivation, I've forgotten them. Oh yeah, that's what I wanted to talk about. Seriously, a 16 hour day followed by a 20-hour day with four hours sleep in between isn't for the amateurs. I'm afraid I haven't been terribly coherent or socially acceptable, but hey, who needs that at work? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, if anybody who's seen me in the last couple days stumbles on this, I'm really all right most of the time, but my short term memory goes to shit when I don't sleep. And since what little social grace I have doesn't come naturally, the mental energy I normally use to interact goes more toward remaining upright and breathing and such. For some reason, I can do photography until I pass out. And have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this post, this blog is officially longer than my old one, payingoffmyloans. And while I had that blog, I didn't pay on my loans at all. I thought about finances a lot, mostly because I was always broke, and the conclusion I came to was that I needed more income. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for the first time met someone in the real world who'd read this before I knew them. I have a link in my email sig to the main site, and he saw this. And there was a weird moment when I thought, what did I put up there that I wouldn't want him to see, and I really couldn't think of a thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog0522-3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is good.

          <description>actually, everything is happening all at once, making blogging hella difficult. Gotta keep it real, and do you know, the real world is awesome?

I almost did myself, but the kid who did it was closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exhibit B:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog518-2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was downtown last night, and for the first time in a long time, there was life, real people out having a good time as if OKC were a real city.

          <title>interesting times...</title>
          <description>Despite the dark cloud of unemployment and impending insolvency, I've been remarkably up this weekend, mostly because I think I finally got out of the hole of a job I was in. The money was too good to give it up but not good enough to set aside what I thought of it, of the whole situation. I was a sell out, and I really hate that I did that even for a little while. Of course, I needed that period of transition to get out of the stupid funk I was in after coming back to oklahoma. A little distance for a little clarity, time to think without impending doom, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silver linings, right? In disaster lies opportunity, phoenix has to burn first, etc, etc. I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have told you, but there are two versions of the story of hope in the greek mythos. This is before the great greek philosophers went and clogged western thought for the next few millennia. Anyway, they say Pandora opened her box and let out all the evils in the world. Curiosity, they say, and they're not the only ones to blame all the world's ills on curiosity or women (although I think the former gets us into more trouble). Well the two versions are different because of where hope comes from at the end. In one telling, it  is the last feeble curse to flap out of the box. In the other, the gods take pity on us poor dumb humans and give us hope, to make up for all the cruelty and misery and nonsense that they gave us. (A box that can never be opened? Totally a set up. Pandora is innocent!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I believe the former, sometimes the latter. Sometimes hope is the only thing that keeps a fool like me going, and sometimes it is the only thing that leads me to do the things that I know are right and good. It has, a couple of times, caused me to fall on my face. I feel better having fallen than I would if I'd stayed at home, though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures later, when I have something to post.</description>

          <title>sleep depping...</title>
          <description>Let's see, it's been a while since I rapped at ya'... like before last saturday, I think. I can count how much sleep I've had since then on my fingers and toes. 1+4+4+2+4=15 hours since noon friday. It's amazing how quickly it catches up with you. Stupid insomnia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, Denver was nice. I finally got the burrito I've been craving, from illegal pete's. Met this really cool gay nurse. I would have loved to talk to him a little more, because he knew a lot about medical things I'm curious about but never had anyone to ask. Like he knew a new thing for me to try for my insomnia, a protein called theanine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, then I got on a plane and came home, slept four hous and then drove an hour and a half to get to work. Work was easy and good and they're paying, which is so huge of a plus I'm going to be in the black eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-6.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog513-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

          <title>I'm listening to tom waits new thing</title>
          <description>Orphans: Brawlers, bawlers and bastards. It's a mix of amazing things that blow my mind and amazing things that creep up behind me and hit me over the head and totally unbelievable things that really can't be said but can only be heard. Really, if you're too poor to afford this album, go steal it. It's easy enough, and totally worth going to jail over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good news front, I've got everything I need for work on tuesday. Laundry is washing, to get me ready for a flight tomorrow. I'm going to Denver for some tests to get into a study. The upshot is I get free blood pressure meds, free monitoring of a kidney problem I've got, and a free plane ride every so often. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_kidney_disease&quot;&gt;Polysystic Kidney Disease&lt;/a&gt; (adpkd) is what I've got. In my family the onset is a little earlier than average. My aunt had renal failure at 48, my uncle in his early forties, my grandmother at 46 or so (I don't know exactly because she wasn't born yet). My mom, and this is the good news, is 51 and is six months to a year from going on dialysis (they usually start dialysis before total kidney failure, at 15-20%). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've known about this since I was about 16. I was having headaches, went to the doc, he diagnosed me with high blood pressure and because of my history ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis. So, I know that in about 27 years I'm going to get really stuck and tied-down (in dialysis) if not just plain dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's OK. I have a plan, and yes, I know how it ends, six feet under. It's what happens between now and then that makes a difference. I've just gotta burn hotter, faster, and better than the rest, that's all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's see, I've been emailing with Lora over the past few days. I was pissed, and I let her know about it. I've gotten over being pissed, and we're finally talking, which is an improvement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adorama.com/ICAS5.html&quot;&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt; hotness, just for my job. It'll do. Anyway, more pictures later, when I'm done looking at today's take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Waits is now God, replacing Virginia Woolf.</description>

          <title>today's post brought to you by pure awesome</title>
          <description>so I can't sleep. stupid insomnia. The pure awesome in the title is all the good things that happened to me today. The hard drive issue was resolved, and now I have more storage on board my laptop. unfortunately, I don't have any music any more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in the good news column, Dillon called to give me a heads up that his boss would be calling to give me a job with his company. And then his boss called and I've got the job. Which means I won't be joining the apprenticeship after all, and I'll be making almost three times what I would have anyway.  I GOT A JOB DOING PHOTOGRAPHY! YAY! That alone is enough to make my day. But then....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The I decided to go out and celebrate, and Dillon says, meet me at the blue note, and oh yeah, Joanna's in town. SoI try to go to the blue note, only I get lost, then I find a gas station with a phone book, then I go to the address and there is the bar. And the Voodoo Glow Skulls were playing! Yay! They rocked so hard and so loud the air got thick, the mosh pit was so intense I was dizzy just shooting pics of it. Anyway, these are my to selects, I'm going to go try to sleep now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog58-2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

          <title>no photos this time...</title>
          <description>and thereÅ› a good reason for that actually. My pecious MacbookÂ´s hard dive died. I maen, like,  really dead. Making bac clicking and hig pitched grinding noises, dead. So Im blogging from the handheld while a new install of mac osx is working. Luckily for me, I have a ton of hard drives sort of laying around. I spent about half of last night (when I was supposed to go out and have a beer) trying to download and install &lt;a href=http://www.ubuntu.org&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, but for some reason the install disk didnÂ´t work in either my momÂ´Å› laptop or mine. Then, while I was trying to find a 6-pin to 4-pin firewire adapter, I found the restore disks for my current laptop, which Id assumed were gone forever. By then it was 3qam though, and so I went to sleep. Which explains why Im doing an install in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had My interview to be a plumber yesterday. It went pretty well, although I shouldnÂ´t have mentioned my photography, for some reason the guys doing the interview couldntÂ´understand how someone could be two things at once. The answer, of course, is very carefully if at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WeÂ´Äºl see. I got 10th on the list and 8 have already been called, which means IÂ´m #2 on the list right now. I dont really want to go out as a plumbing apprentice. Seems boring. Welding on the other hand is the magic that holds the world together, quite literally. The interview for that is tomorrow. I know what not to say this time too.</description>

          <title>I am a rocker and a roller</title>
          <description>not really. I just feel good because I'm drunk. oh, drunkblogging. and making up words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went out to the bar tonight to celebrate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gestaltnews.com&quot;&gt;first issue&lt;/a&gt; and I sit at the bar next to these two chicks, Melodi and Kat, all decked out prettylike and pretty soon we're talking and I'm like whoa hold on and I run out to the car to get my camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I get back in and I'm like &quot;Can I get a picture?&quot; and they're like sure, no problem, so I get a couple snaps. Then I hit the head, and make the obligatory self portrait. hey, hanging around Alex nursed my nascent narcissism.  I'm an alliterative drunk. With a spell checker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I come back out, realize I'm out of money, and I head home, right after I make another pic of the hotchicks and random dude. Then I got home, thought for a second, grabbed a pack of smokes, and went back, only to find the hotchicks had left. And if any of us hadn't been broke we'd all still be drinking. Last call is right about now in most places in this town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, the reason I'm still drunk is there's this bottle of wine on my desk, you see. It was helping me do javascript last night and earlier today, and that didn't kill it, but I'm about to. I know that sounds like an alcoholic talking but really I don;t drink that much. It is fun when I do though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog54-3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I just found &lt;a href=&quot;www.librarything.com&quot;&gt;LibraryThing&lt;/a&gt; which is maybe the most amazing thing on the internet ever. I jumped up and down and scared my cat when I realized what it is. You get to catalogue your books and find people with the same stuff/interests. WOW. And the wine is gone and there are pics to edit for this post. Hope everyone is out there having as good a time as I've been having.</description>

          <title>I can now think in html</title>
          <description>and that's not really a bad thing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getstaltnews.com/&quot;&gt;Gestalt&lt;/a&gt; is up and running with its beta issue. The gallery is some nifty javascript which needs just a little tweaking to be really wonderful. There are a lot of things I'd like to get fixed before the next issue, mostly more content. I don't really like the headline font now, although it seemed perfect three weeks ago when we picked it. Google ads aren't online yet. For anyone who'd like to contribute a story, just &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mail@gestaltnews.com&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;. Ok, now I gotta get away from the computer. Later</description>

          <title>thunder and lightning</title>
          <description>I'm typing this up from the handheld, watching a movie. It's a little weird, but it'll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been thinking about my photography, about how I tend to be blurry a lot. The thing is, I'm constantly trying to not be blurry. Fast lenses, fast ISO, steady hands. The problem is life is blurry sometiems, it moves very fast, is fleeting, never stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a storm today, looked like it might produce a tornado right over my house. There I am in the miiddle of the road, takng pictures, mom yelling at me to come inside. So, after watching for another minute, I did. The truth is though that I would have stayed out there and watched the storm. There wasn't any real danger, just hailstones. The tornadoes all touched down a mile east of here, really small ones. We did get some pretty big hail though. and then another storm in the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog51-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's funny how things work out sometimes. I really wanted to write a post earlier today about how excellent and wonderful girls can be sometimes, even while they're exasperating, but the energy's all gon out of me. maybe later. but things are good, the house is still here, and I'm still talking to everyone. Gestalt is going to happen, even if we only have five pieces in our first issue.</description>

          <title>Since I'm going to spend the greater part of tomorrow working</title>
          <description>I'm going to spend at least some of today outside in the sunshine. It's a good day for it. I spent all day yesterday sitting inside on my ass. I was reading, which is good, but I really wish I'd gotten out a little, so now, here I go. Before I head out, random picture:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog430-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog430-1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

          <description>t-bone steak and some cheap red wine.

Arts fest was cool; I was less of a chickenshit and shot more looking through the viewfinder. Then I called up Sabrina, asked what she was up to later, she was doing a bunch of stuff, but she would call me when things were happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went home, chilled, mom came home, I started to take a nap. Just as I was really falling asleep, the phone rang, 'Rina and some peeps were at Logan's roadhouse, and I should join them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten minutes later, I'm there, and who's hanging out but Pixie, Chris, Sabrina, and cool dude who's name I can't remember. If he weren't cool, I'd just say dude. I remember he's celibate, by choice, and maybe one of the most thoughtful people I've ever met. All present were cool, and it turned interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pixie is this super boisterous wonderful hotchick who I'd met briefly before, but she was blacked out, so this was one of those sort of first meetings. She's tough, been to the wars. Supposed to teach me tantra, although she was drunk when she said that so I won't hold her to it. That, and I'm not sure about our respective situations re: other partners. It would be fun, just some good sex, but really, I'm waiting for Jess. (Edit: life is complicated but good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, drinking ensued, and continued until about 1:30 (we had moved locations several times, and ended up at a pizza joint in the paseo). Stop for beer/gum, and then we went to Pixie's house, where there was some beer drinking and some tv, and then Sabrina and cool dude left, pixie fell asleep on the couch, so I downed my beer and said my goodnight. Hey, there's something to be said for being a gentleman, even now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORE Pictures! The first one is Pixie, the second is this creepy wax sculpture. You can figure out the rest on your own time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-6.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog426-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

          <title>blogging is a sport for the morning...</title>
          <description>Here I am, it's morning, hello everyone. Been a bit since I rapped at ya, been busy. Every thing is up in the air, and with a little luck, I'll keep it all that way. All china and razor blades, flying around my head, propelled there by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm so incredibly stoked about Gestalt it's not even funny. Every single one of the editors are singularly amazing, and I'm glad as hell they're working with me. Hey, sometimes to get the best people all you have to do is ask them. We had our first meeting on tuesday, and it was a blast. They've all got great ideas, and they're on board for the direction I'd like to see the magazine go in, in terms of how it's run and whatnot. So that's great. Deadline for the first issue is next wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't been wandering about as much of late, mostly because my longtime wandering partner has been busy. Today, though, there is the arts fest, which should be great. I'm gonna go down and see what kind of trouble I can get myself into. now, photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw these pieces of pipe cut, I thought they must have a macine to make the edges so even; turns out that's just how well my dad can use a torch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the dude that won, TIG welding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Georgie, waiting for the winners to be announced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog424-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the Winner is...

          <title>Weird situations...</title>
          <description>They seem to just keep cropping up. I'm up to my eyes in weird shit lately. First there was my case of the weirds last thursday (or was it friday? I'm too lazy to check), then there was the apprenticeship contest saturday, then there was a beauty pageant saturday night, and now Lora's not answering texts, even though we were supposed to have an editors meeting. Strange but true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the apprenticeship contest. My dad asked me Friday morning if I wanted to go and photograph, ,and I said of course. I got up at 4am,  after about 5 hours of sleep,  and went to teh union school, where the contest was to be held. 90% of the guys that even bothered to be in the competition wee idiots. Every time I walked into the plumbing room, where all tha various plumbing tasks were happening, I got looks from about half the guys, like they didn't want me to be there. Oh well, I got my pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Mike likes 'em, though he told my dad in no unncertain terms that I was in the program. Just as I find out I have the opportunity to do photography (boring, mind-numbing photography, though), I have a sure job doing something else, something interesting. Hard work, sure, but there isn't a job in the world worth doing that isn't difficult in some way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there's that, and then there was this pageant. Mom's friend Georgie from work had her daughter  in the Miss Hispanic UCO pageant, and she won. And since mom didn't want to go alone, and I think wild horses couldn't have dragged dad out to something like that, I went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organization of the program was shit, the MC was laughably bad, stuck to the script to thte detriment of the show, etc, etc. On the plus side, there were three very attractive ladies posing in also attractive outfits (including swimsuits), dancing four our entertainment, etc. Which made it a worthwhile outing. Now I've been at two major events in this girl's life, her quincinera, and now this pageant. Georgie had me come and photograph at the quincinera about four years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And from there I went home and to bed. Weird dreams that I can't remember. I made brunch. eggs and bacon and home fries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grocery store with mom, dinner, out for coffee. Still reading don q, and it gets better as it goes. That's all Ive got for now. pics to follow when I feel like it later.</description>

          <title>approaching 10k photos with my trusty 5d</title>
          <description>Which means, that along with the other 5D I had and shot over 7,000 pictures with, I've shot more photos with this camera than any I've ever owned, since last August. Lightroom has the number of photos I've taken since I got back from brazil at a staggering 14,000. That's 389 rolls of film, at $4/roll, plus 4 for dev costs... $3112 that I haven't spent on film. Of course, I've spent far more than that on cameras, but really, who's to say that I would've had better luck with film cameras? Anyway, this is all just idle speculation. Now, some pictures. This is the lens that inspired the title of the post about being an artist....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog419-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog419-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This woman was feeding the ducks.

A photo-project, an essay to commit myself to. More later, when I've had more time to think.</description>

          <title>Today couldn't get better...</title>
          <description>Well, it could, actually, but I don't think it's possible within the bounds of physics and or psychology. My lady, who could improve the situation, is 600 miles away, and there aren't any others. Did I mention the amazing French wine I got for ten bucks? Cote du rhone, no less. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today started out really excellently. I woke up at 2am after 12 hours of sleep, more than I've gotten in almost a week. Then, I read some Don Quixote. Really, if you haven't read this book, you should. Not only for the hilarious moments, but for the ones in which you begin to wonder what is real and what isn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee with the 'rents. Always a pleasure. Dad wants me to photograph at the Apprentice contest tomorrow. So, I'm getting up at 5am to go shoot pictures. So what else is new?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he and my mom go off to work, and I get glued to this short story collection, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcrw.net/kessel/&quot;&gt;The Baum Plan for Financial Independence by John Kessel&lt;/a&gt;. Link goes to a free download page, because sometimes the good things just fly into your hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I pry myself away from the story and head out for adventure. Then I realize I left my outgoing mail on the corner of the desk, so I pull a u turn and go back for it. Then, back on track for adventure. Wherever the wind, my short supply of gas, and my legs will take me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I parked at Bass Pro Shops downtown, and walked toward the city. I knew there had to be a post drop box somewhere in there. I mean, it's a city, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'm walking. I get through Bricktown, which is the entertainment district, and I'm in and among the few skyscrapers OKC has. None are terribly tall, but we at least have an honest skyline. Well, viewed from the east anyway. it kinda sucks from the west. I passed a hotel, asked a dude in a uniform if he knew where a post box would be. He looked at me like I was crazy, from mars or something, and well, to tell the truth, I felt like I was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemme back up a little. As I stepped out of the house, I looked around and everything looked profoundly weird. The trees were trees and the grass was grass and the sky was still that faded hazy blue I know all too well, but it seemed like it shouldn't be that way. It was real as a slap in the face, but it seemed wrong, like false notes. And I didn't shake the feeling until much later in the day. It's not something you get used to so much as ignore until you forget. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the bellhop didn't know where I coud mail my letters, but the concierge did, told me inside the frist national building, down the escalator, and off to the right. And what sould I find when I followed his directions but a full service post office? Very Nice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I walked the tunnels that are under OKC for a little bit. I moved maybe five hundred yards along my route, going first east then north, getting lost, and finally deciding that I sould go to the surface, where I had better bearings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I was back on the surface, I knew where I was, and struck off in the right direction. The Independent Artists' Alice show was up, and I want to smack whoever curated it in the face. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't get me wrong. There was some exceptional work in the show, some of it even good photography. But the problem is they let in everybody, so it seemed, and as much as a third was crap, and it didn't ever really gel for me as a show. It was a bunch of individual pieces on the wall, and they were in the same gallery, but there was no unity. I really liked some of the individual pieces, though. I'll throw some up when I throw photos up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, since I was just around the corner, I went and got a coffee at Java Dave's and said hello to Lora. She was having a shitty day, too many assholes. To the assholes in the world: Be nice to the people that make your food and drinks, because they have a lot of opportunities to fuck with you and you'll never know about it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there, I wandered a bit more, then hitched a ride with Lora to my car, and came home. Talked to Dillon, he might have a job doing photo for me. Then I went to the liquor store with my dad, found the aforementioned wine, which I need another glass of. Photos to follow soon.</description>

          <title>On being an artist...</title>
          <description>So, my blog hero (because everybody needs something to aspire to) posted about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2008/04/if-children-are-to-learn-anything-about.htm&quot;&gt;telling kids to be an artist&lt;/a&gt;. I want to say, here and now, being an artist isn't all million dollar paintings and getting hot babes. Those are side effects, and not everybody gets 'em. Some of us are still broke our whole lives, just doing it because there isn't anything else we can do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ain't easy being an artist. There are always haters. Critics. People who see something good and just want to tear it down. The hard part is knowing when they're right and you suck and when you gotta just shake 'em off, and the answer is, they're always wrong. You know your faults better than anyone, they don't know shit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't be an artist for the money. Don't do it for chicks, or for the image. Most artists don't have an image. The best ones are sort of humble and bashful when you try and tell them they're good. Don't be an artist because it gives you license. If you need a license, it isn't art. If you have to do it, if there's no way to stop whatever it is that comes out of you, that's art. You can't make art because you want to, you do it because you have to, because that little voice inside won't let you live and breathe and be at peace unless you're creating. You do it and do it and do it, and if you're lucky you know some people who get it, and if you're really really lucky some of those people will pay for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't be an artist unless you have a fanatically strong stubborn streak. The real test isn't who's selling for millions at the Tate or the Met or Southeby's, but who sticks to their guns, never admits failure, even though they've gotta take a shit job at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_(novel)&quot;&gt;Post Office&lt;/a&gt; to cover the bills, they still do it, they turn that into their art. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not good going crazy, having stupid sleeping disorders that make it impossible to  hold a regular job for more than 6 months, that make you want to run screaming into the night chasing after whoknowswhat. It's a special kind of madness, and it takes a huge wack of talent not to end up in the nuthouse walking that razorwire tightrope. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there's no net. Inevitably you fall. Sometimes you flap your arms on the way down and hope, and sometimes because you are that creative motherfucker, because you belong up there, flying, you grow those wings, and astound the world.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you wanna be an artist, bust it out or go back to school and find a nice safe life. This isn't nice and it isn't safe and it isn't stable. Here there be sleepless nights and crazy manic 72 hour sessions in the studio and the only way you can keep it together is because there's no other way for you to be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, artist chicks are hotter.</description>

          <title>so, there was once a man from nantucket</title>
          <description>no, not really. No men have ever come out of Nantucket. /nonsense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, it's been a good couple of days. I'm getting editors all on the same page, all but one of us has a section we're responsible for, and things are going well in general for gestalt. Gestalt is the magazine I'm starting that anyone can write for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's see, where did we leave off? Last Friday, I think it was. So, on friday, I woke up sore, sometime around three in the afternoon. did some vague things around the house, found the photos I've been promising Sabrina for forever, went over to Frankie's  house to give them to her and hang out. Hung out there for a while, drank some beers. Talked a little about religion, and little innocent me, I just sat there with my mouth shut while dude was talking about his male christian conception of god, and how that was natural and innate in all of us. Sometimes it's better to just shut your mouth, and this was one of those times, because besides that little hitch, dude was pretty cool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's see, other than that... had a boring saturday. Finally went to bed at around 4am, got up at 8:30. Blueberry muffins for breakfast, then we went to sams, where we bought a bed for my dad finally. Which means I have my room back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets say that again: I HAVE MY ROOM BACK! YAY! Hey, if I can't shout from my stupid blog, where can I shout from?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, got most of my stuff into the room, organized a little, then I had to do yard work for a while. Mow grass and clear sticks and such. My knees are killing me today, but the rest of me is all right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, 'cause we haven't seen each other in a few days, I went out to get coffee with Lora and hang out for a bit. She was in a weird mood, really distant. I was no help, because I was really happy about the room and talking to Jess earlier. I have a feeling what's wrong for Lora, but if I say it out loud it won't be true, even if it is. I was really tired while we were walking, from the yard work, and pulled out my phone to check it. I had to stare at it for a minute to make sense of what it was saying. Then I put it away, and Lora said something, I forget what, and I explained that I just couldn't make sense of the phone, had to stare at it for a second, but it still wouldn't resolve into something that I understood. And she said, yeah, I'm having one of those moments with my life right now. So yeah, I hope she's all right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after that, all I did was come home and drink bourbon. Despite my usual bad luck with that particular liquor, I was fine, finally went to bed at a reasonable time after almot two weeks of being fully nocturnal. Of course, then I woke up at 4:30 am. Now, pictures.</description>

          <title>broke and still getting out...</title>
          <description>It's good to have friends. It's even better to have friends that are close enough that they don't give a shit that you're broke, they want you to come out anyway. &quot;You broke? It'sa no problem!&quot; (in my best italian accent). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, I woke up and cleaned the kitchen. Then Dillon called, and he was working on his house. Bro is 23, has two houses, has the second hottest girl of anyone I know, doing well for himself. Anyway, he was wondering if maybe I wanted to come over and see the place, and I said, sure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house is in a depreciated area; not the ghetto, but just a couple blocks north of it. Hardwood floors, rather small really. Nice workshop out back. He was taping off everything in the house that wasn't getting painted, and me being me, I picked up a roll of tape and helped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 hours of that, we went to this bar over on the north side of town, and damned if I can remember the name. 63rd and may, well, north of 63rd about a hundred yards. The waitress was nice but royally screwed the tabs, and for some reason I couldn't make a shot to save my life. This is different from my normal pool playing, where I can hold my own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there, when the bar closed, there was the required beer stop and then a very fast drive to an apartment where two of the guys that were with us at the bar lived. For some reason a lot of these kids drive souped up cars. Anyway, one of the guys is a chef, and he produced a morel mushroom, which I had to try. When a chef at a five star tells you something is the best, it's a rule, you've gotta try it. (I once wrote a long essay about trusting good cooks, even if it isn't something you normally are into. I normally don't like mushrooms, for example). And, it was suprisingly good. A little grit, which he ascribed to a brief soaking (5 hours instead of 8). And the he brought out the steak. This delicious, amazing steak, super tender. Nrmally part of the ribeye, he said, and he sells them for $75 bucks a pop at his restaurant. As h'ors d'oeuvre with friends playing video games. Fucking awesome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, what was everyone doing while noshing on that deliciousness? Playing Rock Band, a game that takes conspicuous consumption to a whole new level, and is really fun looking in the process. They played the game, I took pictures. It worked out. Next time on Five Years: Pictures, and what I did with my friday...</description>

          <title>ok, so people are coming here again, YAY!</title>
          <description>And by again, I mean for the first time. Hi everyone, even you people who were looking for &quot;Matt Mills porn&quot; in google. No porn here, just good clean photography. While I might occaisionally take pictures of scantily clad women, naked ones even (although that hasn't happened in a while; other things to do when I get naked with a girl, you know), there's no porn here, and don't hold your breath. Seriously, it's a little weird that someone is searching my name with porn. Could be worse. They could be searching &quot;Matt Mills assassination.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a good couple of days. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.html&quot;&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt; keeps on rocking out, although some easy to find permalinks would be nice. The top and third posts as of this writing, about needing to write every day, are awesome, the reason I keep going back to his blog, even when he's dragging, even when some weeks he only posts about shit I don't want to hear. Because in 7 years reading his blog, he's been consistently pulling out awesome writing like that, sooner or later. And all the hotchicks, I'm not gonna lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the good news is that I'm doing all right. Several good things have happened to me in the last 24 hours. I had a primo steak for dinner, fresh french fries, all delicious. I then went and had coffee with Lora and Sabrina, two friends of mine, both of whom I owe pictures, sorry girls, I swear I'm on it right after I write this. Lora had to go home and sleep, she works, and I can't decide if I'm jealous of her having a job, you know, with income, or if I'm glad I'm not tied down like that, needing to be in bed by a certain time. Although that never stopped me from staying up before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that left me and Sabrina to run around town a bunch. Sabrina's an old friend, from high school, but I haven't seen her since last fall, so we had a bit of catching up to do. We talked for a while, drove around some, and got out and walked some too. The photos are from the walking and the driving. Yes, I take photos even when I'm driving sometimes. I do it really fast, and I never leave my lane, although sometimes a little swerving is involved. So yeah, we walked and talked, and before you know it it was 11:30 and Sabrina's husband was calling and asking where his wife was, and so we ambled back to the car and I took her home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went home and read for a while. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johndiesattheend.com/&quot;&gt;John Dies at the End&lt;/a&gt;  is a really cool story. A little disconnected at times, but worth reading. Really scary at points, too, something that few stories do for me. To answer the riddle at the beginning: No. By the way, the title is deceptive. That's all I'm saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog410-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so with that out of the way, I gotta go do up the photos. Peace everyone/MAtt</description>

          <description>I was going to blog about my night, but then I decided not to. Let's say there was pool and drinking and staying out very late indeed, good times had by all, and leave it at that. oh yeah, and I lose a thousand words to a stupid mistake.</description>

          <title>The things I carry...</title>
          <description>So, because I have nothing to blog about right now, I thought I'd blog about what I think of as my adventure kit (edit: Yes, it's a purse, no, that doesn't bother me. A;though the wallet and keys and such are in my pockets, not in the bag). It's a bag I carry almost everywhere, and has all of my essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have my camera, an EOS 5D, and the 50mm 1.2 lens mounted, excellent for us nocturnal beasts. Also pictured is the utilitarian 24-105, which keeps me from having to carry five fixed lenses, god bless it. In the column of camera stuff, there's also the waterproof card wallet and the extra battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's also the mundane stuff: A metal wallet, cell phone, swiss army knife, pens, notebook, tiny flashlight, business cards (the black thing on the wallet is my business card holder). A tin of altoids for breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but certainly not least is the Nokia N800, which is a gadget, I'll admit, but I stay on top of email with it, and it's a lot lighter than a laptop. It does everything a bigger computer does, only smaller. Now if someone would just help me figure out how to easily get the RAW files from my camera out to small jpegs for blogging, I'd hardly need a laptop at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what do I carry it all in? I'm glad you asked. This is the Emsquared Super Adventure Plus 2.0 camera bag, with kevlar strap, in handsome gray fabric.  The ESAP features a main compartment of 9x4.5x6.5, with three subdivider pockets for organization. Seriously, I knocked this together last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog47-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but it needs some breaking in. Which I'm going to go do now.</description>

          <title>Midnight Bike Rides Make Everything Better</title>
          <description>I just rode 25 miles, thither and yon and back again, here in oak shitty (that's oklahoma city, for those not in the know). I feel a lot better. So, thanks, Alex, for introducing to me how awesome they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about this town: the wind is fucking killer. As in, it will kill you sometimes, whether you're watching or not. I was almost knocked over a couple of times by gusts. I have to wonder if anyone here does a wind blog, with all sorts of wind related ephemera?  Wind jokes,  stats, photos,  videos... hmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, about halfway through my ride, I was crossing the highway on an overpass, and I saw these signs. The wind knocked them over, I swear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Just the road...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog46-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Self-portrait in black and white.

          <description>Like something out of a sci-fi novel, I came home and found myself already in my bed. What the hell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Hey, what are you doing here?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other me sat up in bed. &quot;I'm here from the future. I need to tell you something very important.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What? ok, you're from the future. What kind of day will I have tommorow, so I know you're on the level?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;You'll wake up, go pick up lora for sodas, go have the meeting with only three editors, and then... well, that's what i'm here to-&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then he dissappeared. Yeah, this didn't really happen. I just didn't feel like putting up pictures right now, feeling lazy. have fun without me, internet.</description>

          <title>starting sh!t</title>
          <description>Yep, the last week has been a doozy. Let's see... I started out with a hangover and cold. I decided to build a camera, and to get everyone else in the world to help me. www.opensourcecamera.org. I also finally got around to starting that magazine, called Gestalt, www.gestaltnews.com. I took some photos, wandered around a bit. Talked to Lora some, maybe straightened out some things with her. Haven't talked to Jess, though, hopefully she'll get back to me soon. I had a nice day driving around today, anyway. I'm gonna let the pictures tell the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;&quot; 0px=&quot;&quot; auto=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elaine's new installation...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At the bar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img  src=&quot;http://www.photographermattmills.com/images/blog328-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I don't think he likes me.

          <title>time to explain myself</title>
          <description>My last blog was 100k of fun in the sun, a blog about my time in Santa Fe, and supposedly about paying off my loans. I stopped blogging there when I decided I just didn't have time for it any more, and nobody was reading. But now I'm at home, and I'm about to enter into a five year long apprenticeship program, in pipefitting, which is how to weld pipe, any kind, any metal, plastic, anything. At the end of the five years, I'll have all my debts paid off and a decent amount of savings. Which means I'll probably hit the road. The vagabond lifestyle for a while. The good thing about being a pipefitter is that there's enough work, plenty of money to live on and save, and plenty of time between jobs to go places if I want to. So this is a blog about my life learning to be a pipefitter and still being a photographer at the same time. I don't think I could ever stop taking pictures; not having it as an income stream just sets me free to make the pictures I want to make. Of course, that makes it more difficult when they're halfway around the world, but I'll figure that out when I get there.</description>

          <title>fuck movable type.</title>
          <description>Seriously. I've been dicking around with it for like two days, couldn't figure out how to customize the layout. I know nothing of PERL and really don't want to know. The reason I can't figure it out is mainly because the settings are all spread out over about 20 files, whereas with blogger, they're all in one spot. not to say blogger isn't a pain in the ass, and eventually I'm going to make my own template, but for the moment, it's blogger, and it'll look like this.</description>
